OK, OK. I gave up the first time. But now I have the time, I'm gonna give iAtkos a go. I gave up with the Lion, and now I have even given up with Snow Leopard, so I am resorting to Leopard. This might work. MIGHT.

But hey, I always have Windows 8... oh wait, that's crap. What have they done to the start screen? Ruined it.

Alex, signing off, will report back soon.
