				<title>CreativeBloq Interview</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Following my nomination for a Net Award in the Emerging Talent category, CreativeBloq reached out to me for a short interview over email. They published it on Thursday, along with interviews from some of the other nominations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own head this interview makes me sound fairly sure of myself -- I&amp;#39;m really not -- but I wanted to answer their questions as best I could. There are a few weird things that they left in, like the half sentences at the end of each Little Printer publication description; I was expecting them to edit those into full sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really expecting to win the award - all the other candidates seem to have worked with more discrete clients than me - but I&amp;#39;m happy to have even made it this far. I know that&amp;#39;s something people say on the X Factor when they&amp;#39;re expecting to lose, but it is nice to have my work put in front of some of the most important leaders in the web design industry.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cloudwash by BERG</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Since BERG finished their transition into being &amp;quot;Cloud services for hardware innovators&amp;quot; (at least for the moment), I&amp;#39;ve been eagerly awaiting their new prototypes that they&amp;#39;ve been hinting at for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, after &lt;a href=&quot;http://bergcloud.com/case-studies/flock/&quot;&gt;FLOCK&lt;/a&gt;, is their next fully fledged internet connected device prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obvious that a lot of thought has gone into this, and BERG as a company are exploring how the internet will become part of our everyday lives in a unique way. I&amp;#39;m excited to see what they come up with in the future (and what I&amp;#39;ll come up with using my Devshield - I&amp;#39;ve already got some ideas which I&amp;#39;ll post when they&amp;#39;re ready for the world).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Cheapest Android Tablet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dslrfilmnoob.com/2013/12/11/tp-link-tl-mr3040-wireless-field-monitor-dslr-controller/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on a filmmaking website about how you can turn your Android tablet into a wireless DSLR monitor through the purchase of a $30 battery-powered wireless router.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been looking for a way to wirelessly control/monitor my camera for a while - partly for events when I want to put a camera somewhere else for a different angle without a second operator, and partly for when I have my camera on a Steadicam (or a cable cam -- more details to follow) and need to monitor my camera without using cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem was that I didn&amp;#39;t have an Android tablet. At first I thought I&amp;#39;d look at the price of a used Nexus 7, but it was around £80 and I didn&amp;#39;t want to shell out that sort of cash for something like this. iPads can&amp;#39;t do this because of the way Apple locks down developers&amp;#39; access to the Lightning connector, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I conducted an experiment. I looked for the cheapest Android tablet I could find on eBay to see whether it would be up to my needs. I settled on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/NEW-7-DUAL-CAMERA-DUAL-CORE-MULTI-TOUCH-SCREEN-TABLET-PC-ANDROID-4-2-2-br-/301069194415&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for a whopping £35 with free shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic test criteria were: it should be able to run the DSLRController app as it should, as well as being able to provide some light entertainment through Plex, iPlayer/ITV Player/4oD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it arrived. The box looked mostly presentable, and reminded me of the box of one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Yahui-Player-Media-Music-Audio-Blue/dp/B00GW995TK&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;, from when I had one before I got an iPod Nano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-box.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I perused the back for information was puzzled to see that this tablet usually retails for £99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-back.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specs of the tablet weren&amp;#39;t so surprising any more, given the price it had been intended to be sold at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon opening, I was greeted with a vague attempt at Apple-style packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-open.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath this layer, accessories had been haphazardly thrown together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-bits.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was pleasently surprised by the tablet itself. It didn&amp;#39;t seem too flimsy, and other than a few stupid design issues like having the power cable come out of the top, it seemed on the whole decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booted it up, and after proudly declaring that it was a &amp;quot;Nebula 1701&amp;quot;, it launched straight into Android 4.2.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go into detail about Android itself, because I&amp;#39;m biased and would never use it willingly in everyday life for anything other than content consumption - but the user experience is as good as I could have hoped for on something this cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my delight, it passed both my tests of functionality: I was able to successfully wirelessly control my 5D Mark III:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-dslr.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And watch HD films from Plex once I&amp;#39;d updated my server to the most recent version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I&amp;#39;d say if you don&amp;#39;t want a tablet for anything other than to fulfill a set of basic tasks, this is well worth the £35. Frankly, at that price, you could even just buy one to play around with. If you want to do anything more, however, I&amp;#39;d still recommend an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Building My First 3D Printer</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For Christmas I was fortunate enough to recieve a &lt;a href=&quot;http://printrbot.com/shop/printrbot-simple/&quot;&gt;Printrbot Simple kit&lt;/a&gt;. We got it through an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Printrbot-3D-Printer-Simple-KIT-/131069073264?pt=UK_Computing_Other_Computing_Networking&amp;amp;hash=item1e84535770&quot;&gt;eBay seller&lt;/a&gt; based in the UK who had stock and fast shipping. At the time of writing, the kit cost £312.75, which is staggering - given how much 3D printers cost only 5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started building it on Christmas day afternoon and had it finished by the evening of the 27th, with a day off in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://25.media.tumblr.com/4cddc90e957873ec84906a3bbd507068/tumblr_myhoa8dCnc1r3akzno1_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Assembled Printrbot Simple&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could buy the assembled Simple, but that&amp;#39;s no fun - and building one teaches you what each individual component does so it&amp;#39;s much easier to fix anything that breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to tell you how to build one, you can find out how to do that &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.printrbot.com/Guide/How+to+Printrbot+Simple/52&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. That walks you through the nitty gritty of getting one formed from the kit as it comes in the box. However, I thought I&amp;#39;d point out a few things that I wished I&amp;#39;d known the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be an idiot and try to put the M3 bolts through the microswitches like I did. The M2 ones are the tiny thin bolts that are hard to spot in the bag of components unless you empty them out onto the desk. If you do what I did, you&amp;#39;ll deform and shatter the microswitches. Luckily, I found replacements &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/miniature-microswitch-with-lever-n96aq&quot;&gt;at Maplin&lt;/a&gt;. At £2.09/each it&amp;#39;s a huge ripoff, but I could collect them at 9am on Boxing Day in person to continue my build as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s definitely worth having some spare zip ties around. I picked up 100 that are identical to the ones that came with the kit for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/self-locking-cable-tie-100mm-100-pack-fp16s&quot;&gt;£2.29&lt;/a&gt; on the same outing to Maplins. It&amp;#39;s useful if you mess up and need to cut and redo them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two nylon spacers in the pack! The smaller one is meant for the filament to go through in the extruder assembly, the larger one is just used as a spacer. Don&amp;#39;t try and cram the larger one into that multi-layer plywood box - it won&amp;#39;t work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you panic at the end of the build because you appear to have lost the hot end power cable - don&amp;#39;t worry! You attached it to the circuit board earlier as instructed and have since forgotten about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;ve got it assembled, I&amp;#39;d highly recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://joshondesign.com/p/books/simpleguide/text.html&quot;&gt;this 4,000 word epic&lt;/a&gt; about getting your Printrbot communicating with a computer, calibrating it, and finally printing your first somthing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24238&quot;&gt;first thing&lt;/a&gt; I printed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://25.media.tumblr.com/51b76686b68a131097c797f00292c430/tumblr_myhpy7gQld1r3akzno1_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;25mm Calibration Cube&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it&amp;#39;s much larger in the x direction than it should be, and not as tall as it should be. Following the calibration steps outlined in the guide above meant that the next version was exactly 5mm on every step as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Control&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing I did, mainly because I could, was to make the printer run wirelessly over the internet from a Raspberry Pi using &lt;a href=&quot;http://octoprint.org&quot;&gt;OctoPrint&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, you&amp;#39;d have to have your laptop plugged into the Simple for the whole of the build duration - but with this you can upload an STL over WiFi to your Pi and set it going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is super-convenient as it means you can leave the house or do something else with your laptop without distrupting your printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you have a webcam that&amp;#39;s compatible with the Pi, you can monitor your prints remotely and even save timelapses of them. They won&amp;#39;t be of the highest quality obviously (there&amp;#39;s a reason I own a DSLR with Magic Lantern installed), but they&amp;#39;re quick and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Modifications&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of modifications out there that people have done on their Printrbot Simples. For instance, Reddit user /u/snickerpleez who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/PrintrBot/comments/1pkwqa/i_doubled_the_size_of_my_simples_print_bed_for/&quot;&gt;doubled the size of his print bed&lt;/a&gt; for $35 or Elkniwt on Thingiverse&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:121820&quot;&gt;arbitrarily long print bed&lt;/a&gt;, or even this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:97847&quot;&gt;spool holder made from Bic pens&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/JasperJ/collections/printrbot-simple-mods/&quot;&gt;huge list&lt;/a&gt; compiled by JasperJ of all the things other people have done with their Simples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular seems to be placing a glass or aluminium sheet over the plywood to act as a print bed. This makes sure it&amp;#39;s perfectly flat and exempt from the problems of warping. This is the one I plan to try soonest, and apparently a good source of glass is a cheap 6x4&amp;quot; photo frame, of which I have a few lying around unused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, and adding LEDs. Because they look awesome. I spotted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.printrbottalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=106&amp;amp;t=4066&quot;&gt;good idea&lt;/a&gt;over on the Printrbot Talk forum that I&amp;#39;ll have to try out some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Who&amp;#39;s this for?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to ask this question, I&amp;#39;d highly recommend you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/08/home-3d-printers-take-us-on-a-maddening-journey-into-another-dimension/&quot;&gt;this great review&lt;/a&gt; of the Simple over on Ars Technica. The kit will take you at least 3 hours of continuous work if you vaguely know what you&amp;#39;re doing, much more if not (some people have taken up to 8). This printer is for hackers and casual 3D-makers. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hp3dprinting.co.uk/uprint-se.htm&quot;&gt;HP uPrint SE&lt;/a&gt; that makes perfect prints every time. You will have to spend hours obsessing over calibration and hot end temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&amp;#39;t sound good to you, then don&amp;#39;t buy this. But also don&amp;#39;t buy a Makerbot Replicator 2 for $2200. That won&amp;#39;t solve your problems. Instead, wait 5 years - and find another hobby in the mean time. This printer is for early adopters and not for the faint of heart. Look at the difference between 5 years ago and now, and think about where we&amp;#39;ll be in 5 year&amp;#39;s time. It&amp;#39;s exciting - I can&amp;#39;t wait to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Behind the Scenes of Gravity</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was hoping for something a little more in-depth, and that&amp;#39;s probably coming, but for now this 5 minute video gives us a peek into how Gravity was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of super-awesome motion control rigs and lighting simulation. They make lifting heavy cameras and actors look effortless, which - considering how powerful they are - is hardly surprising, and a little bit terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Super-low budget sound equipment</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got some really exciting projects coming up in the next few months in the small cracks in the blocks of time taken up by my GCSEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of those projects, and for many to come, I&amp;#39;m going to need some (at least) semi-pro location audio equipment, and I saw some great deals on eBay so I nabbed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a brief overview of what I bought and why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000YCSHG8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000YCSHG8&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&quot;&gt;Rode NTG-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This microphone is fantastic for the money. It&amp;#39;s not exceptional, but that&amp;#39;s because it costs £160 not £500. It doesn&amp;#39;t produce a very &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; (strong) signal, so you&amp;#39;ll need some good preamps either in your recorder or externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds great and full, and I&amp;#39;ll be using it for all my outdoor work (interviews, dialogue, etc). I got it for £100 on eBay including the 10 year warranty which is fantastic for such an inexpensive microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000U7B90I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000U7B90I&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&quot;&gt;Rode NT5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was somewhat of an impulse buy as I saw it for a great bargain (£50) on eBay. I&amp;#39;ll use it for interior dialogue on both narrative work and for conferences, talks, and others. This is because it has a cardioid pickup pattern, so it does not pick up sound reflections from behind like the NTG-2 does. These reflections &amp;quot;colour&amp;quot; the sound and amplify echoes while dumbing-down the intended source of audio when inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also multi-purpose because it can be used to record high-SPL sources, like drums and kicks, as well as violins and other instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005NACC6M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B005NACC6M&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&quot;&gt;Tascam DR-40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the cheaper (and better, in my opinion) Tascam version of the Zoom H4N, which is wildly popular amongst indy filmmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be powered by 3 AA batteries, or via USB from a wall charger or from a phone battery like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00D5T3QK4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00D5T3QK4&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which will last you all day and more with a 15000mAh capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tascam has many recording modes for a variety of scenarios. It has two XLR inputs for external microphones which can be recorded together as a stereo track, or additionally with a backup track at -10dB to get you out of trouble if you find the mic clipping unexpectedly. It also has two internal microphones, so you can record 4 tracks simultaneously if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It retails at £185, but look carefully on eBay and you might find it as low as £100 like I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001IFZEV6?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=3194&amp;amp;creative=21330&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001IFZEV6&amp;amp;linkCode=shr&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&amp;amp;=electronics&amp;amp;qid=1377876716&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=rode+blimp&quot;&gt;Rode Blimp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thing is so cool. Not only is it a shock mount that isolates the microphone from vibration and handling noise when on the end of a boom pole, it also prevents wind noise from tampering with your recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is so effective that I can literally point an industrial fan at it and there is no wind noise on the recording at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have seen a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rodemic.com/accessories/deadcat&quot;&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/a&gt; before, but that&amp;#39;s nothing to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rodemic.com/accessories/deadwombat&quot;&gt;Dead &lt;em&gt;Wombat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that comes with this thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also comes with a 10 year warranty, and I expect it to be a fantastic piece of equipment for working outdoors with the wind cover, and indoors as a shock mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got it from eBay for £130, but I&amp;#39;ve seen ones go for as low as £100 is you&amp;#39;re lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Accessories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve got all of that stuff, you&amp;#39;re going to need the bits and pieces to put it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought my cables from Thomann, Europe&amp;#39;s largest music shop. Sure, you could buy cheap XLR from Amazon, but when you&amp;#39;ve got a nice mic and recorder, it seems stupid to make the link between them weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thomann.de/gb/cordial_ctm_5_fm_mikrofonkabel_red.htm&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; 5m cable for boom pole and general use. It&amp;#39;s red because that&amp;#39;s awesome, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thomann.de/gb/search.html?gk=kamf&amp;amp;bn=Cordial&amp;amp;pr=&amp;amp;kf=on&amp;amp;oa=pra&amp;amp;wgfid1=8137&amp;amp;wgfid2=8577&amp;amp;wgfid3=10330&quot;&gt;any Cordial&lt;/a&gt; will do. I especially like the ones with the Neutrik connectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;ve got the gear I just need to go out and make something with it, which I&amp;#39;m very excited for. I have two short films on the horizon, one of which I will direct and the other I&amp;#39;ll be DP, as well as some shorter projects like Club Drama 2013 (see last year&amp;#39;s one &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/55469257&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you then!
Alex&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going on a trip soon on which I will be taking my video, photo and timelapse equipment, and thought I&amp;#39;d share a brief overview of how I pack my stuff to make sure it doesn&amp;#39;t get damaged in transit or stopped by airport security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, my cameras and lenses go in my Lowepro Flipside 300, along with my rMBP 13&amp;quot;. This is small enough to carry on, and that way I have all of the expensive and breakable things with me at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Jessops tripod ball head for photography, and a Manfrotto 502AH fluid head for filmmaking. I tend to take both, as they&amp;#39;re not particularly heavy and there&amp;#39;s no point having this stuff if you don&amp;#39;t use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how much I&amp;#39;m carrying in my camera bag, I might put the ball head in there, or in my suitcase. It&amp;#39;s fairly robust and won&amp;#39;t be broken if dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My video head on the other hand is what I might call fragile. There are several knobs that protrude from the outside of it that are made of plastic, and are easily broken if not protected properly. I learnt this the hard way on my trip to Nice, where the locking knob for the pan handle snapped clean in half after having been put in the overhead lockers on the aeroplane. Learning from that experience, I take the pan handle and other knobs off the head and put them in my suitcase padded by my clothes to make sure they&amp;#39;re not damaged. I then put the head itself on the tripod in my Manfrotto 80cm tripod bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m carrying a slider, I either put it in my tripod bag, or put it diagonally inside my suitcase to keep the carrying weight down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a DIY Arduino timelapse motor and belt system for my slider, which I&amp;#39;ll go into more detail in a later post. An Arduino looks suspicious through airport security, and so I&amp;#39;ve found it best to put the Arduino and cables in my carry-on luggage, and the batteries in my checked-in bag. The staff at Terminal 5 had no problem with this, and through a scanner the electronics look like any PCB they&amp;#39;ve seen before. My suitcase went &amp;#39;missing&amp;#39; when I had the Arduino in it on the way back from Nice, although this may have just been a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take care of your expensive equipment, and always carry the most valuable and fragile items with you. This may seem like common sense, but I&amp;#39;ve seen many people put laptops in their suitcases and heard many sob-stories of how that turned out after baggage handling dropped their suitcase 10 meters onto the tarmac.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Little Firefly Publication</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I made another Little Printer publication. This time, it wasn&amp;#39;t a personal project as much, as I worked closely with Firefly Solutions using their APIs and hosting it on their Amazon EC2 instances. I wrote a guest post on their blog, which details what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Word on Filtering</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read a lot about David Cameron&amp;#39;s proposed internet filtering system, and the flaws and pitfalls associated with it, and I was so frustrated by the obvious and fundamental lack of understanding about the internet within the government that I was moved to write a letter to my MP (Mary Macleod) explaining why this idea should be killed or at least seriously reconsidered before being put into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Mary,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a concerned citizen of Chiswick, I&amp;#39;m writing to you regarding David Cameron&amp;#39;s proposed filtering system, championed by Claire Perry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As somebody that works as a web developer and systems administrator, there are a large number of things that concern me about this scheme that I really would like to highlight to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief these reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filter simply will not and cannot achieve what it sets out to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/node/21559929&quot;&gt;Security concerns regarding Huawei&lt;/a&gt; who will be controlling it, and their alleged connections to the Chinese military and international espionage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious human rights issue regarding censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell you from experience as somebody who has a deep understanding of the technologies the internet is built on that filtering  systems are only ever partially effective. This is because it is difficult to decide whether or not to block a website. The main method I&amp;#39;ve experienced is to maintain a database of website addresses and to assign each website a category. No matter how that database is built it is always at least partially wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then there is the question of how websites that are not in the database should be handled. Should they always be blocked? If so you will block every website that has not been categorised regardless of whether it contains porn or other totally unrelated material. This could potentially be extremely harmful to the UK economy as many companies rely on their websites to function and to turn a profit. If you allow all uncategorised sites through the filter then you have effectively declared your web filter useless because it will never keep up with the new sites as they appear and change name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can already see this with the blocking of the Pirate Bay and other BitTorrent websites. In theory, the Pirate Bay should be blocked in the United Kingdom. This couldn&amp;#39;t be further for the truth. The original blocked URL is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepiratebay.se&quot;&gt;thepiratebay.se&lt;/a&gt;. The same site is available at many other addresses that have not been blocked, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://pirateproxy.se&quot;&gt;pirateproxy.se&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bich.in&quot;&gt;bich.in&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pirateshore.org&quot;&gt;pirateshore.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://proxybay.info&quot;&gt;many more&lt;/a&gt;; and the filtering system will never be able to catch up to the new proxies as the appear.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if it is impossible to block one single website, how do you propose that this web filter will block all pornographic material? There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship#Approaches&quot;&gt;many more methods&lt;/a&gt;, but they are equally inaccurate, time-consuming, and riddled with problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the problems with Huawei: Michael Hayden, who used to head the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and is also a retired United States Air Force general, said in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afr.com/p/national/transcript_interview_with_former_KnS7JDIrw73GWlljxA7vdK&quot;&gt;an interview with Australian Financial Review&lt;/a&gt; that Huawei had shared “intimate and extensive knowledge” of the telecommunications infrastructure it is involved in with the Chinese government. AFR also reported that General Hayden has seen “hard evidence” of spying activity performed by Huawei, the world’s second largest telecom equipment manufacturer, on behalf of the Chinese government. In essence we will be pumping all of our internet traffic through a corporation known for spying. Just one of a huge number of by-products of this filtering system that David Cameron has neglected to take into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why make a system that is untested and unproven opt-out instead of opt-in? It is up to the parents of any individual household to take responsibility for the safety of their children, not for the government to act as a nanny-state, the very thing that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/nov/17/society.smoking&quot;&gt;Conservatives heavily criticised&lt;/a&gt; in the previous Labour government?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this filtering system goes into place I will use one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.eff.org&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://weise7.org/tmp/cryptobook-v1.1.pdf&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/postmodern/5018337&quot;&gt;known methods&lt;/a&gt; to stop the government and Chinese spying on my internet traffic, and I know without a shadow of a doubt that I am not alone in this sentiment. This is not something the UK government wants to happen, and it certainly is not something they want to go to a human rights court over (which is what will happen when they decide what I&amp;#39;m doing is illegal, which is what the US seems to be doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://a.markpond.com/544a4f59f691574154a60b8539ebf914/&quot;&gt;right now&lt;/a&gt;. You shouldn&amp;#39;t have to ask for your rights, they should be given by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell the whole point of this scheme is to &amp;quot;protect the children&amp;quot;. The irony of this is of course that children are the best placed to evade these blocks for themselves. Anything becomes far more desirable when it is forbidden, and as such children will not hesitate in finding methods to get around this filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more dangerous aspects of this filter is that it lulls parents into a false sense of security. Many people believe that this filter will instantly make their children completely safe from harm online, which is blatantly not true. A far better idea is for the parents to properly educate their children (and themselves, if needed) about the Internet, its dangers, and how to avoid them. Never in my 10 years of using the Internet as a source of information and entertainment have I accidentally come across something I have not wanted to see, and judging from the reaction online, many people have had the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless stopped, this plan is likely to waste huge government and taxpayer funds, as it is doomed to fail from the start. Australia recently tried to implement a filtering system similar to the one described by David Cameron. After recovering heavy criticism from large technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple, the Australian government had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-09/government-abandons-plans-for-internet-filter/4362354&quot;&gt;admit that their plan had failed&lt;/a&gt; like all before and all after it, as it had misclassified 97 million porn sites as safe, and 97 million innocent and safe sites as dangerous. It became a sinkhole for government funding and had to be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, along with the fact that Claire Perry who is spear-heading this project has a fundamental lack of understanding as to how the Internet works, as demonstrated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2013/07/24/technologically-illiterate-mp.html&quot;&gt;her recent reaction&lt;/a&gt; to the hacking of her website, makes this project a monumental waste of time and money and will ultimately lead to huge embarrassment on the part of the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron and his spin doctors have been cunning in the way he has presented this filter to the public to minimise backlash - how could anyone be in favour of child abuse? But these are two very different issues, and he has lumped something that is &lt;em&gt;already illegal&lt;/em&gt; and something entirely legal together in the name of &amp;quot;saving the children&amp;quot;. And this is just the beginning. According to ISPs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/uk-porn-filter-will-censor-other-content-too-isps-reveal-130726/&quot;&gt;there is much more that will be filtered by default&lt;/a&gt; than just porn and child abuse (such as &lt;em&gt;social networking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;file sharing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;games&lt;/em&gt;) - stuff that is not harmful on the whole and not illegal. And if the parents feel this stuff is inappropriate and their children should not see it, there are &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; measures in place that parents can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for your time in reading this, please do whatever you can to inform those who have the ability to stop this what a monumentally bad idea this filter is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Forey&lt;/p&gt;
