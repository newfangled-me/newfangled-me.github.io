				<title>Glass Envelope - Short Film</title>
				<description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/104504079?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    

&lt;p&gt;So, I made another film. This time set in Cornwall and about a boy who finds a letter in a bottle. There&amp;#39;s also a Behind the Scenes video, made by Amos Jackson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/104182118?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the reason behind the huge lack of posts between April and now was that I was revising for, taking, and then subsequently recovering from, my GCSEs. For this I apologise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the good news is that I&amp;#39;ve actually finished one of the many projects I&amp;#39;ve had up in the air recently - in this case a short film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amos, Hugo, Albert, Paul, James, and I went up to Albert&amp;#39;s house in Cornwall for a celebratory weekend after the end of our exams and me being me, I decided to use the occasion to make a short film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had planned the trip a couple of months in advance, and so I solicited Josh Cleary, a scriptwriting friend, so see if he had any ideas for what we could do while in Cornwall. He went away and came back a while later with a fully formed script that would hardly change between the first draft that he presented me with and the final film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then compiled a mountain of gear - although only what I thought we needed - and figured out how we&amp;#39;d get it all to Cornwall and back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos-a.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xpf1/10472029_1439521309642672_1326131195_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;All the things!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert&amp;#39;s parents graciously offered to drive some of it down and back again, so we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to crush it all onto the train. You can take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wu3mE1TUJSRHsdnj1PjmROBVfQSIWQ76LCINM_LXAFg/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Shooting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most of the films I&amp;#39;ve made, we actually shot the first scene first. For this, our location was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Port+Quin,+Port+Isaac,+Cornwall+PL29/@50.58872,-4.866804,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x486b9de2b4d7d9fb:0x2889102ebccfd3f1&quot;&gt;Port Quin&lt;/a&gt;, a small and rarely-visited inlet near the more popular Port Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first conversation between the two brothers was shot in two parts - the first shot by itself and then the rest of the scene. The first shot was done on my Konova slider, to allow the frame to be pulled back far enough to get the actors in frame in one go. The rest of the conversation was then shot with two cameras simultaneously, to make my life easier when editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of that scene is unremarkable, other than this photo of Amos sitting on a rock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos-a.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xpf1/10471987_303419959834064_135673827_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amos&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that day, we filmed scene four - the one where Oliver forgets his hat, as well as the final shot, in a huge field that had a public footpath going through it. The final shot is my favourite of the film, purely because of the landscape in the foreground and the cliffs in the background. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We initially shot scene four on my Steadicam Merlin (which is why in the BTS video you can see us using it), however, later I decided that that location didn&amp;#39;t work because it didn&amp;#39;t provide enough context between the house and the last shot, so we packed up for the day and returned to the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We backed up the footage to as many hard drives as I&amp;#39;d brought (I think it was 3 but I can&amp;#39;t remember) and left the batteries to recharge overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we shot all the interiors, scene four again, and all the pickup shots of the letters - which took longer than we expected (as it always does).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second and third favourite shots of the film are the two slider shots we did in the study: the gradual push-in when Oliver starts writing letters, and the push through the window when Luke comes to collect the letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos-e.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xfa1/917125_768161956538980_801073035_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Push through the window&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Post-production&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did in post was to record the voiceovers. We did this with my Røde NT5 on a mic stand, and a DJ t-bar stand holding up a blanket around it to deaden the noise significantly. This was really useful to get rid of some of the extra noise present when living under the Heathrow flight path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I went on holiday and so the film was on hold for a little time, while I made my &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/102942840&quot;&gt;Summer in Dubrovnik&lt;/a&gt; video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a whole month later, Amos, James, Hugo and I reconvened at Amos&amp;#39;s house for a small amount of editing-by-committee, to show off what I&amp;#39;d come up with and to see if anyone had any suggestions. For the most part not much changed, and then two days later we met up at my house with Josh to see what he made of the rough cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of slicing later and it was ready for Josh to write his score, which he composed in his head over the course of about 15 minutes. After a couple of practice runs, we recorded it on my electric piano straight into my 5D (because my Tascam had died at some point in between the voiceovers and then).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos-a.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xaf1/10601823_324633471039232_1842315460_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Recording the score&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pointed the 5D at the timecode that was playing alongside the video on the laptop so we could easily sync it up later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we took everything back to the edit suite for sound mixing, which was surprisingly painless and quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos-a.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xpa1/925600_841583919200256_1918369181_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Editing&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also one other thing to be done: in the first shot of scene four, the boom pole goes through the top of the frame. So I took it into After Effects, duplicated the layer and free-framed it on a frame where the boom was not covering the house. I then masked around the house, motion tracked the original layer, and then attached it back on so the boom now passed behind the house. Finally, I added a solid that was the same colour of the sky, put it behind the house, and masked it so - at last - the boom pole was hidden. Here&amp;#39;s a gif:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ge-boom.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Boom removal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the process of colouring. First of all we went through all the shots and corrected them so the full tonal range of the image came out without crushing the blacks or clipping the whites, and once we were happy I went through and graded it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there was a problem. Sometimes, on some shots, there would be a random blue colour overlaid onto some of the frames. At this point it was getting on for 21:00 and we were all a bit bleary-eyed, having been going for 10 hours since the morning. We decided to call it a night, after having tried everything from rendering individual clips to messing with the render speed settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone went home and in the morning the solution to the blue flashing problem came to me: I noticed it only happened on shots where I had adjusted the transform (&amp;quot;motion&amp;quot;) settings in Premiere before sending the timeline to Resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through all of the clips and removed these changes in Resolve&amp;#39;s edit tab, and as if by magic all the blue frames disappeared. I did a final render of all of the footage, round-tripped them back into Premiere, added the titles and audio back in and did the final export.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you&amp;#39;ve found this post at least slightly interesting - and I&amp;#39;ll return with another for my next film, &lt;em&gt;The Fair&lt;/em&gt;, when it&amp;#39;s done which will be before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if it wasn&amp;#39;t going to be, it has to be now - I&amp;#39;ve published it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Making of Russian Ark</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across &lt;em&gt;In One Breath&lt;/em&gt; recently, a film about the making of &lt;em&gt;Russian Ark&lt;/em&gt;, a one-shot 96-minute masterpiece covering several centuries of Russian history set in the Winter Pallace in St. Petersberg. It&amp;#39;s an amazing feat of cinema with appearances from over 2,000 actors all in period costume and 3 orchestras only a single night of filming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full film, shot on video to keep the load down on the Steadicam and to increase recording time, is available on YouTube for your viewing pleasure (although probably not for much longer...):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/sE2jRxToAjQ?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behind the scenes film, in 5 parts, and well worth a watch too, and it covers various aspects of the difficulties of shooting a feature film in 36 hours, which was the amount of time they had before they were kicked out of the museum.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Art of Typography and its Relevance in the Modern World</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this piece last summer as part of my English Language iGCSE coursework. After many months of stress and feverish revisions, I submitted it along with a Literature essay and various other small bits and pieces to the exam board, AQA, last Monday. Having done that, I&amp;#39;m free to publish it - and as a few of you have expressed interest, I thought I might as well do so. You better appreciate the styling, becuase I had to write out all the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements you can see in the source by hand to get it looking like my Pages document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: the previous typo in the title was not part of the submitted coursework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the invention of the Gutenberg Press, typography has had an enormous influence on culture and has shaped our interpretation of every piece of written language - from road signs all the way up to novels and scientific proofs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to explain further why typography is so important, it is worth mentioning what it is, and what scope it covers. The art of typography is broadly divided into three separate areas: the letters themselves, text as a whole, and the layout of the text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several aspects to crafting letters, the most important of which is typeface (sometimes also known as font). Depending on the style of document or text being typeset, you’ll need to choose between a serif and a sans-serif typeface. Serif typefaces include small lines that trail from the end of the letter forms, and tend to be used as the body typeface in formal documents or other long-form text. Sans-serif typefaces are mainly used for titles, as well as informational or lighthearted pieces. Typefaces can also be broken down differently, not by their use of serifs, but by their style. Common examples of these include ‘script,’ which is used to emulate handwriting; ‘slab serif’ which has little or no variation between the thickest and thinnest part of the letter; ‘modern’ with large differences between the thickest and thinnest points; and finally ‘old-style’, which is a tribute to the origins of physical typesetting. Finally, there are ‘decorative’ typefaces that don’t specifically fit into any of the above categories - and should not be used for anything other than titles, if at all. There are other variables that can be set when styling a letter, such as weight: the thickness of the letter. Increasing it is often referred to as ‘bold’ in word processors - but in reality weight can also be adjusted the other way. Both &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 300&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 700&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; share the same typeface, but at different weights. A thicker letter often gives a heavier and old-fashioned feel, whereas a thinner letter gives a lighter and more modern impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The look of the text can be shaped by several factors that determine the relationship between each letter. Line-height, or the space between lines of text, is also very important in discerning the ‘readability’ of a piece of writing. Thin line-height is often harder to read, but exaggerated line-height can make a paragraph feel more like a series of separate ideas, which can confuse the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while standard kerning does not have a direct impact on the reader, an &lt;span style=&quot;letter-spacing: -3px&quot;&gt;inco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;letter-spacing: 8px&quot;&gt; rre&lt;/span&gt;ct ke&lt;span style=&quot;letter-spacing: -3px&quot;&gt;rni&lt;/span&gt;ng can have the opposite effect and disconcert the reader. Kerning is the space between each letter, and is used to stop letters from touching accidentally. It is especially important when designing titles, as the reader does not necessarily ‘read’ the text, but sees the shape of the words and interprets them visually - and thus any discrepancies can throw the reader off-balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have decided on a style of lettering and text, the next important aspect of typography is to consider the layout of the text which tends to be driven by a (normally invisible) grid system. Without you realising it, every time you open a new Word document you create a grid system of a set of margins and one column. Margins are part of a much larger idea of ‘whitespace’, which is another hugely important aspect of typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;This&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;seems much more important than the rest of the text here because of the amount of whitespace surrounding it, despite the fact that all the text has the same size and weight. A few words with a large whitespace emphasises the type, whereas a large block of text with small margins can be difficult to read and can cause the reader to accidentally skip lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Ratio is a design theory invented by the ancient Greeks, and it was used heavily in the designing of their temples and other buildings. Typography borrows from architecture in its use of this rule, which can be employed to create more pleasing layouts; however some designers claim that it is no better than other methods for creating layouts, and a good design originates more from the size and aspect ratio of the paper used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grid can also be made up of margins that cross text horizontally, to create space between paragraphs. This type of lateral whitespace is called a hang line, and is commonly used to maintain the flow of a piece where an image is used to illustrate the point being made on the right or left of the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so now you know what typography is, it is worth explaining how it works. Throughout the years, various typefaces have gained a reputation in the industry for their effect on readers, and their characteristics. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Helvetica&quot;&gt;Helvetica&lt;/span&gt; was one of the original sans-serif typefaces, freeing designers from the standards of &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Times New Roman&quot;&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/span&gt; and other serif fonts since its creation in 1957. It allowed the designers to create modern designs for modern times, and is a ‘trustworthy’ typeface, with no frills and no surprises - every letter is consistently designed. It has been used by thousands of international companies over the past 56 years, with variants appearing in the branding of Jeep, American Airlines, Microsoft, Post-It, and even British Gas - and through this use it has become somewhat of a stereotype. To begin with brands used it because of its sensibleness, then others started using it by default, with the result that it has now become severely overused. That is not to say that you should not use it in designs, but you should also be aware of alternatives that could fit your designs better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end of the spectrum however, we have &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Comic Sans, Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;Comic Sans&lt;/span&gt;. This is a good example of where typography should be used with caution: typography has such an influence on how the reader interprets text that a wrong choice can often be catastrophic. Comic Sans was initially designed for use in comic book speech bubbles, and quickly became popular in primary schools and other children’s literature due to its inclusion in all variants of the Microsoft Windows operating system since Microsoft Bob in 1994. At one point it even had an eye in its &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Comic Sans, Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;€&lt;/span&gt; character. Eventually, however, people started using Comic Sans for all types of documents, driven by its popularity and child-like appearance: hospitals and even governments were using it for official documents. This resulted in serious information being conveyed by a comical typeface. All typefaces have a place and a purpose, and inappropriate use of Comic Sans can mean that people do not take the information seriously, thus rendering the document meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of choice of typeface can be well demonstrated by a real-world example from 2009: IKEA changed their standard typeface. This sort of change is not remarkable in itself; many brands change their branding ‘identity’ often to keep the customers interested and to ‘stay fresh’. Normally customers do not notice or discuss such changes, but in this case everyone had formed an opinion, and there was much argument both online and in other media such as newspaper columns and BBC radio. The general consensus was that &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Futura&quot;&gt;Futura&lt;/span&gt; was a much more elegant and appropriate font than &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana&quot;&gt;Verdana&lt;/span&gt;, which they made the change to. Typography makes up part of IKEA’s public identity, and a switch from a well-established image resulted in lack of consumer confidence, and even a small drop in sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IKEA’s change was mostly decided upon in order to keep their design consistent between their printed information and their website, which had always been set in Verdana. This was because in 2009, Verdana was one of the only fonts that could be used on the web, as it is included by default on all computers. In 2009, new web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3 had not yet been invented, meaning that website designers could only use fonts that everybody already had. However, in December of 2012, these new technologies were officially standardised, and included a feature called ‘@font-face’. This feature allows web designers to embed fonts into web pages, without the user needing to have them installed on their computers; as well as freeing them from the constraints imposed on them by technology, it allows them to create more diverse designs and fulfil their vision onto the screen. This change is important as, whether we like it or not, eventually print media will begin to disappear as more people move to the web. The extra variety in typefaces that this change allows will encourage people who care about typography to be less sceptical about the web, and to embrace the new technologies associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this change had not occurred, typography would be the limiting factor in people’s appreciation of content online. Now designers can use whatever typeface they want, provided they have the relevant licence to do so - delimiting the influence of typography on modern culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typography has always been relevant to the way people perceive the written word, and with the advent of the web and social media spreading links to articles and information, its relevance is only going to increase over time.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>CreativeBloq Interview</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Following my nomination for a Net Award in the Emerging Talent category, CreativeBloq reached out to me for a short interview over email. They published it on Thursday, along with interviews from some of the other nominations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own head this interview makes me sound fairly sure of myself -- I&amp;#39;m really not -- but I wanted to answer their questions as best I could. There are a few weird things that they left in, like the half sentences at the end of each Little Printer publication description; I was expecting them to edit those into full sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really expecting to win the award - all the other candidates seem to have worked with more discrete clients than me - but I&amp;#39;m happy to have even made it this far. I know that&amp;#39;s something people say on the X Factor when they&amp;#39;re expecting to lose, but it is nice to have my work put in front of some of the most important leaders in the web design industry.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cloudwash by BERG</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Since BERG finished their transition into being &amp;quot;Cloud services for hardware innovators&amp;quot; (at least for the moment), I&amp;#39;ve been eagerly awaiting their new prototypes that they&amp;#39;ve been hinting at for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, after &lt;a href=&quot;http://bergcloud.com/case-studies/flock/&quot;&gt;FLOCK&lt;/a&gt;, is their next fully fledged internet connected device prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obvious that a lot of thought has gone into this, and BERG as a company are exploring how the internet will become part of our everyday lives in a unique way. I&amp;#39;m excited to see what they come up with in the future (and what I&amp;#39;ll come up with using my Devshield - I&amp;#39;ve already got some ideas which I&amp;#39;ll post when they&amp;#39;re ready for the world).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Cheapest Android Tablet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dslrfilmnoob.com/2013/12/11/tp-link-tl-mr3040-wireless-field-monitor-dslr-controller/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on a filmmaking website about how you can turn your Android tablet into a wireless DSLR monitor through the purchase of a $30 battery-powered wireless router.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been looking for a way to wirelessly control/monitor my camera for a while - partly for events when I want to put a camera somewhere else for a different angle without a second operator, and partly for when I have my camera on a Steadicam (or a cable cam -- more details to follow) and need to monitor my camera without using cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem was that I didn&amp;#39;t have an Android tablet. At first I thought I&amp;#39;d look at the price of a used Nexus 7, but it was around £80 and I didn&amp;#39;t want to shell out that sort of cash for something like this. iPads can&amp;#39;t do this because of the way Apple locks down developers&amp;#39; access to the Lightning connector, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I conducted an experiment. I looked for the cheapest Android tablet I could find on eBay to see whether it would be up to my needs. I settled on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/NEW-7-DUAL-CAMERA-DUAL-CORE-MULTI-TOUCH-SCREEN-TABLET-PC-ANDROID-4-2-2-br-/301069194415&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for a whopping £35 with free shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic test criteria were: it should be able to run the DSLRController app as it should, as well as being able to provide some light entertainment through Plex, iPlayer/ITV Player/4oD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it arrived. The box looked mostly presentable, and reminded me of the box of one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Yahui-Player-Media-Music-Audio-Blue/dp/B00GW995TK&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;, from when I had one before I got an iPod Nano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-box.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I perused the back for information was puzzled to see that this tablet usually retails for £99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-back.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specs of the tablet weren&amp;#39;t so surprising any more, given the price it had been intended to be sold at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon opening, I was greeted with a vague attempt at Apple-style packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-open.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath this layer, accessories had been haphazardly thrown together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-bits.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was pleasently surprised by the tablet itself. It didn&amp;#39;t seem too flimsy, and other than a few stupid design issues like having the power cable come out of the top, it seemed on the whole decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booted it up, and after proudly declaring that it was a &amp;quot;Nebula 1701&amp;quot;, it launched straight into Android 4.2.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go into detail about Android itself, because I&amp;#39;m biased and would never use it willingly in everyday life for anything other than content consumption - but the user experience is as good as I could have hoped for on something this cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my delight, it passed both my tests of functionality: I was able to successfully wirelessly control my 5D Mark III:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tablet-dslr.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And watch HD films from Plex once I&amp;#39;d updated my server to the most recent version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I&amp;#39;d say if you don&amp;#39;t want a tablet for anything other than to fulfill a set of basic tasks, this is well worth the £35. Frankly, at that price, you could even just buy one to play around with. If you want to do anything more, however, I&amp;#39;d still recommend an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Building My First 3D Printer</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For Christmas I was fortunate enough to recieve a &lt;a href=&quot;http://printrbot.com/shop/printrbot-simple/&quot;&gt;Printrbot Simple kit&lt;/a&gt;. We got it through an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Printrbot-3D-Printer-Simple-KIT-/131069073264?pt=UK_Computing_Other_Computing_Networking&amp;amp;hash=item1e84535770&quot;&gt;eBay seller&lt;/a&gt; based in the UK who had stock and fast shipping. At the time of writing, the kit cost £312.75, which is staggering - given how much 3D printers cost only 5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started building it on Christmas day afternoon and had it finished by the evening of the 27th, with a day off in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://25.media.tumblr.com/4cddc90e957873ec84906a3bbd507068/tumblr_myhoa8dCnc1r3akzno1_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Assembled Printrbot Simple&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could buy the assembled Simple, but that&amp;#39;s no fun - and building one teaches you what each individual component does so it&amp;#39;s much easier to fix anything that breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to tell you how to build one, you can find out how to do that &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.printrbot.com/Guide/How+to+Printrbot+Simple/52&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. That walks you through the nitty gritty of getting one formed from the kit as it comes in the box. However, I thought I&amp;#39;d point out a few things that I wished I&amp;#39;d known the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be an idiot and try to put the M3 bolts through the microswitches like I did. The M2 ones are the tiny thin bolts that are hard to spot in the bag of components unless you empty them out onto the desk. If you do what I did, you&amp;#39;ll deform and shatter the microswitches. Luckily, I found replacements &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/miniature-microswitch-with-lever-n96aq&quot;&gt;at Maplin&lt;/a&gt;. At £2.09/each it&amp;#39;s a huge ripoff, but I could collect them at 9am on Boxing Day in person to continue my build as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s definitely worth having some spare zip ties around. I picked up 100 that are identical to the ones that came with the kit for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/self-locking-cable-tie-100mm-100-pack-fp16s&quot;&gt;£2.29&lt;/a&gt; on the same outing to Maplins. It&amp;#39;s useful if you mess up and need to cut and redo them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two nylon spacers in the pack! The smaller one is meant for the filament to go through in the extruder assembly, the larger one is just used as a spacer. Don&amp;#39;t try and cram the larger one into that multi-layer plywood box - it won&amp;#39;t work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you panic at the end of the build because you appear to have lost the hot end power cable - don&amp;#39;t worry! You attached it to the circuit board earlier as instructed and have since forgotten about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;ve got it assembled, I&amp;#39;d highly recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://joshondesign.com/p/books/simpleguide/text.html&quot;&gt;this 4,000 word epic&lt;/a&gt; about getting your Printrbot communicating with a computer, calibrating it, and finally printing your first somthing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24238&quot;&gt;first thing&lt;/a&gt; I printed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://25.media.tumblr.com/51b76686b68a131097c797f00292c430/tumblr_myhpy7gQld1r3akzno1_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;25mm Calibration Cube&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it&amp;#39;s much larger in the x direction than it should be, and not as tall as it should be. Following the calibration steps outlined in the guide above meant that the next version was exactly 5mm on every step as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Control&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing I did, mainly because I could, was to make the printer run wirelessly over the internet from a Raspberry Pi using &lt;a href=&quot;http://octoprint.org&quot;&gt;OctoPrint&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, you&amp;#39;d have to have your laptop plugged into the Simple for the whole of the build duration - but with this you can upload an STL over WiFi to your Pi and set it going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is super-convenient as it means you can leave the house or do something else with your laptop without distrupting your printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you have a webcam that&amp;#39;s compatible with the Pi, you can monitor your prints remotely and even save timelapses of them. They won&amp;#39;t be of the highest quality obviously (there&amp;#39;s a reason I own a DSLR with Magic Lantern installed), but they&amp;#39;re quick and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Modifications&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of modifications out there that people have done on their Printrbot Simples. For instance, Reddit user /u/snickerpleez who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/PrintrBot/comments/1pkwqa/i_doubled_the_size_of_my_simples_print_bed_for/&quot;&gt;doubled the size of his print bed&lt;/a&gt; for $35 or Elkniwt on Thingiverse&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:121820&quot;&gt;arbitrarily long print bed&lt;/a&gt;, or even this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:97847&quot;&gt;spool holder made from Bic pens&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/JasperJ/collections/printrbot-simple-mods/&quot;&gt;huge list&lt;/a&gt; compiled by JasperJ of all the things other people have done with their Simples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular seems to be placing a glass or aluminium sheet over the plywood to act as a print bed. This makes sure it&amp;#39;s perfectly flat and exempt from the problems of warping. This is the one I plan to try soonest, and apparently a good source of glass is a cheap 6x4&amp;quot; photo frame, of which I have a few lying around unused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, and adding LEDs. Because they look awesome. I spotted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.printrbottalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=106&amp;amp;t=4066&quot;&gt;good idea&lt;/a&gt;over on the Printrbot Talk forum that I&amp;#39;ll have to try out some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Who&amp;#39;s this for?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to ask this question, I&amp;#39;d highly recommend you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/08/home-3d-printers-take-us-on-a-maddening-journey-into-another-dimension/&quot;&gt;this great review&lt;/a&gt; of the Simple over on Ars Technica. The kit will take you at least 3 hours of continuous work if you vaguely know what you&amp;#39;re doing, much more if not (some people have taken up to 8). This printer is for hackers and casual 3D-makers. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hp3dprinting.co.uk/uprint-se.htm&quot;&gt;HP uPrint SE&lt;/a&gt; that makes perfect prints every time. You will have to spend hours obsessing over calibration and hot end temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&amp;#39;t sound good to you, then don&amp;#39;t buy this. But also don&amp;#39;t buy a Makerbot Replicator 2 for $2200. That won&amp;#39;t solve your problems. Instead, wait 5 years - and find another hobby in the mean time. This printer is for early adopters and not for the faint of heart. Look at the difference between 5 years ago and now, and think about where we&amp;#39;ll be in 5 year&amp;#39;s time. It&amp;#39;s exciting - I can&amp;#39;t wait to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Behind the Scenes of Gravity</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was hoping for something a little more in-depth, and that&amp;#39;s probably coming, but for now this 5 minute video gives us a peek into how Gravity was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of super-awesome motion control rigs and lighting simulation. They make lifting heavy cameras and actors look effortless, which - considering how powerful they are - is hardly surprising, and a little bit terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Super-low budget sound equipment</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got some really exciting projects coming up in the next few months in the small cracks in the blocks of time taken up by my GCSEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of those projects, and for many to come, I&amp;#39;m going to need some (at least) semi-pro location audio equipment, and I saw some great deals on eBay so I nabbed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a brief overview of what I bought and why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000YCSHG8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000YCSHG8&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&quot;&gt;Rode NTG-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This microphone is fantastic for the money. It&amp;#39;s not exceptional, but that&amp;#39;s because it costs £160 not £500. It doesn&amp;#39;t produce a very &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; (strong) signal, so you&amp;#39;ll need some good preamps either in your recorder or externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds great and full, and I&amp;#39;ll be using it for all my outdoor work (interviews, dialogue, etc). I got it for £100 on eBay including the 10 year warranty which is fantastic for such an inexpensive microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000U7B90I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000U7B90I&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&quot;&gt;Rode NT5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was somewhat of an impulse buy as I saw it for a great bargain (£50) on eBay. I&amp;#39;ll use it for interior dialogue on both narrative work and for conferences, talks, and others. This is because it has a cardioid pickup pattern, so it does not pick up sound reflections from behind like the NTG-2 does. These reflections &amp;quot;colour&amp;quot; the sound and amplify echoes while dumbing-down the intended source of audio when inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also multi-purpose because it can be used to record high-SPL sources, like drums and kicks, as well as violins and other instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005NACC6M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B005NACC6M&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&quot;&gt;Tascam DR-40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the cheaper (and better, in my opinion) Tascam version of the Zoom H4N, which is wildly popular amongst indy filmmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be powered by 3 AA batteries, or via USB from a wall charger or from a phone battery like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00D5T3QK4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00D5T3QK4&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which will last you all day and more with a 15000mAh capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tascam has many recording modes for a variety of scenarios. It has two XLR inputs for external microphones which can be recorded together as a stereo track, or additionally with a backup track at -10dB to get you out of trouble if you find the mic clipping unexpectedly. It also has two internal microphones, so you can record 4 tracks simultaneously if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It retails at £185, but look carefully on eBay and you might find it as low as £100 like I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001IFZEV6?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=3194&amp;amp;creative=21330&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001IFZEV6&amp;amp;linkCode=shr&amp;amp;tag=newfme-21&amp;amp;=electronics&amp;amp;qid=1377876716&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=rode+blimp&quot;&gt;Rode Blimp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thing is so cool. Not only is it a shock mount that isolates the microphone from vibration and handling noise when on the end of a boom pole, it also prevents wind noise from tampering with your recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is so effective that I can literally point an industrial fan at it and there is no wind noise on the recording at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have seen a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rodemic.com/accessories/deadcat&quot;&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/a&gt; before, but that&amp;#39;s nothing to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rodemic.com/accessories/deadwombat&quot;&gt;Dead &lt;em&gt;Wombat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that comes with this thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also comes with a 10 year warranty, and I expect it to be a fantastic piece of equipment for working outdoors with the wind cover, and indoors as a shock mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got it from eBay for £130, but I&amp;#39;ve seen ones go for as low as £100 is you&amp;#39;re lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Accessories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve got all of that stuff, you&amp;#39;re going to need the bits and pieces to put it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought my cables from Thomann, Europe&amp;#39;s largest music shop. Sure, you could buy cheap XLR from Amazon, but when you&amp;#39;ve got a nice mic and recorder, it seems stupid to make the link between them weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thomann.de/gb/cordial_ctm_5_fm_mikrofonkabel_red.htm&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; 5m cable for boom pole and general use. It&amp;#39;s red because that&amp;#39;s awesome, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thomann.de/gb/search.html?gk=kamf&amp;amp;bn=Cordial&amp;amp;pr=&amp;amp;kf=on&amp;amp;oa=pra&amp;amp;wgfid1=8137&amp;amp;wgfid2=8577&amp;amp;wgfid3=10330&quot;&gt;any Cordial&lt;/a&gt; will do. I especially like the ones with the Neutrik connectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;ve got the gear I just need to go out and make something with it, which I&amp;#39;m very excited for. I have two short films on the horizon, one of which I will direct and the other I&amp;#39;ll be DP, as well as some shorter projects like Club Drama 2013 (see last year&amp;#39;s one &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/55469257&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you then!
Alex&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Packing Video & Photo Gear for Holidays</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going on a trip soon on which I will be taking my video, photo and timelapse equipment, and thought I&amp;#39;d share a brief overview of how I pack my stuff to make sure it doesn&amp;#39;t get damaged in transit or stopped by airport security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, my cameras and lenses go in my Lowepro Flipside 300, along with my rMBP 13&amp;quot;. This is small enough to carry on, and that way I have all of the expensive and breakable things with me at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Jessops tripod ball head for photography, and a Manfrotto 502AH fluid head for filmmaking. I tend to take both, as they&amp;#39;re not particularly heavy and there&amp;#39;s no point having this stuff if you don&amp;#39;t use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how much I&amp;#39;m carrying in my camera bag, I might put the ball head in there, or in my suitcase. It&amp;#39;s fairly robust and won&amp;#39;t be broken if dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My video head on the other hand is what I might call fragile. There are several knobs that protrude from the outside of it that are made of plastic, and are easily broken if not protected properly. I learnt this the hard way on my trip to Nice, where the locking knob for the pan handle snapped clean in half after having been put in the overhead lockers on the aeroplane. Learning from that experience, I take the pan handle and other knobs off the head and put them in my suitcase padded by my clothes to make sure they&amp;#39;re not damaged. I then put the head itself on the tripod in my Manfrotto 80cm tripod bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m carrying a slider, I either put it in my tripod bag, or put it diagonally inside my suitcase to keep the carrying weight down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a DIY Arduino timelapse motor and belt system for my slider, which I&amp;#39;ll go into more detail in a later post. An Arduino looks suspicious through airport security, and so I&amp;#39;ve found it best to put the Arduino and cables in my carry-on luggage, and the batteries in my checked-in bag. The staff at Terminal 5 had no problem with this, and through a scanner the electronics look like any PCB they&amp;#39;ve seen before. My suitcase went &amp;#39;missing&amp;#39; when I had the Arduino in it on the way back from Nice, although this may have just been a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take care of your expensive equipment, and always carry the most valuable and fragile items with you. This may seem like common sense, but I&amp;#39;ve seen many people put laptops in their suitcases and heard many sob-stories of how that turned out after baggage handling dropped their suitcase 10 meters onto the tarmac.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Little Firefly Publication</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I made another Little Printer publication. This time, it wasn&amp;#39;t a personal project as much, as I worked closely with Firefly Solutions using their APIs and hosting it on their Amazon EC2 instances. I wrote a guest post on their blog, which details what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Word on Filtering</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read a lot about David Cameron&amp;#39;s proposed internet filtering system, and the flaws and pitfalls associated with it, and I was so frustrated by the obvious and fundamental lack of understanding about the internet within the government that I was moved to write a letter to my MP (Mary Macleod) explaining why this idea should be killed or at least seriously reconsidered before being put into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Mary,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a concerned citizen of Chiswick, I&amp;#39;m writing to you regarding David Cameron&amp;#39;s proposed filtering system, championed by Claire Perry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As somebody that works as a web developer and systems administrator, there are a large number of things that concern me about this scheme that I really would like to highlight to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief these reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filter simply will not and cannot achieve what it sets out to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/node/21559929&quot;&gt;Security concerns regarding Huawei&lt;/a&gt; who will be controlling it, and their alleged connections to the Chinese military and international espionage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious human rights issue regarding censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell you from experience as somebody who has a deep understanding of the technologies the internet is built on that filtering  systems are only ever partially effective. This is because it is difficult to decide whether or not to block a website. The main method I&amp;#39;ve experienced is to maintain a database of website addresses and to assign each website a category. No matter how that database is built it is always at least partially wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then there is the question of how websites that are not in the database should be handled. Should they always be blocked? If so you will block every website that has not been categorised regardless of whether it contains porn or other totally unrelated material. This could potentially be extremely harmful to the UK economy as many companies rely on their websites to function and to turn a profit. If you allow all uncategorised sites through the filter then you have effectively declared your web filter useless because it will never keep up with the new sites as they appear and change name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can already see this with the blocking of the Pirate Bay and other BitTorrent websites. In theory, the Pirate Bay should be blocked in the United Kingdom. This couldn&amp;#39;t be further for the truth. The original blocked URL is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepiratebay.se&quot;&gt;thepiratebay.se&lt;/a&gt;. The same site is available at many other addresses that have not been blocked, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://pirateproxy.se&quot;&gt;pirateproxy.se&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bich.in&quot;&gt;bich.in&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pirateshore.org&quot;&gt;pirateshore.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://proxybay.info&quot;&gt;many more&lt;/a&gt;; and the filtering system will never be able to catch up to the new proxies as the appear.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if it is impossible to block one single website, how do you propose that this web filter will block all pornographic material? There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship#Approaches&quot;&gt;many more methods&lt;/a&gt;, but they are equally inaccurate, time-consuming, and riddled with problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the problems with Huawei: Michael Hayden, who used to head the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and is also a retired United States Air Force general, said in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afr.com/p/national/transcript_interview_with_former_KnS7JDIrw73GWlljxA7vdK&quot;&gt;an interview with Australian Financial Review&lt;/a&gt; that Huawei had shared “intimate and extensive knowledge” of the telecommunications infrastructure it is involved in with the Chinese government. AFR also reported that General Hayden has seen “hard evidence” of spying activity performed by Huawei, the world’s second largest telecom equipment manufacturer, on behalf of the Chinese government. In essence we will be pumping all of our internet traffic through a corporation known for spying. Just one of a huge number of by-products of this filtering system that David Cameron has neglected to take into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why make a system that is untested and unproven opt-out instead of opt-in? It is up to the parents of any individual household to take responsibility for the safety of their children, not for the government to act as a nanny-state, the very thing that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/nov/17/society.smoking&quot;&gt;Conservatives heavily criticised&lt;/a&gt; in the previous Labour government?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this filtering system goes into place I will use one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.eff.org&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://weise7.org/tmp/cryptobook-v1.1.pdf&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/postmodern/5018337&quot;&gt;known methods&lt;/a&gt; to stop the government and Chinese spying on my internet traffic, and I know without a shadow of a doubt that I am not alone in this sentiment. This is not something the UK government wants to happen, and it certainly is not something they want to go to a human rights court over (which is what will happen when they decide what I&amp;#39;m doing is illegal, which is what the US seems to be doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://a.markpond.com/544a4f59f691574154a60b8539ebf914/&quot;&gt;right now&lt;/a&gt;. You shouldn&amp;#39;t have to ask for your rights, they should be given by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell the whole point of this scheme is to &amp;quot;protect the children&amp;quot;. The irony of this is of course that children are the best placed to evade these blocks for themselves. Anything becomes far more desirable when it is forbidden, and as such children will not hesitate in finding methods to get around this filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more dangerous aspects of this filter is that it lulls parents into a false sense of security. Many people believe that this filter will instantly make their children completely safe from harm online, which is blatantly not true. A far better idea is for the parents to properly educate their children (and themselves, if needed) about the Internet, its dangers, and how to avoid them. Never in my 10 years of using the Internet as a source of information and entertainment have I accidentally come across something I have not wanted to see, and judging from the reaction online, many people have had the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless stopped, this plan is likely to waste huge government and taxpayer funds, as it is doomed to fail from the start. Australia recently tried to implement a filtering system similar to the one described by David Cameron. After recovering heavy criticism from large technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple, the Australian government had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-09/government-abandons-plans-for-internet-filter/4362354&quot;&gt;admit that their plan had failed&lt;/a&gt; like all before and all after it, as it had misclassified 97 million porn sites as safe, and 97 million innocent and safe sites as dangerous. It became a sinkhole for government funding and had to be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, along with the fact that Claire Perry who is spear-heading this project has a fundamental lack of understanding as to how the Internet works, as demonstrated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2013/07/24/technologically-illiterate-mp.html&quot;&gt;her recent reaction&lt;/a&gt; to the hacking of her website, makes this project a monumental waste of time and money and will ultimately lead to huge embarrassment on the part of the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron and his spin doctors have been cunning in the way he has presented this filter to the public to minimise backlash - how could anyone be in favour of child abuse? But these are two very different issues, and he has lumped something that is &lt;em&gt;already illegal&lt;/em&gt; and something entirely legal together in the name of &amp;quot;saving the children&amp;quot;. And this is just the beginning. According to ISPs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/uk-porn-filter-will-censor-other-content-too-isps-reveal-130726/&quot;&gt;there is much more that will be filtered by default&lt;/a&gt; than just porn and child abuse (such as &lt;em&gt;social networking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;file sharing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;games&lt;/em&gt;) - stuff that is not harmful on the whole and not illegal. And if the parents feel this stuff is inappropriate and their children should not see it, there are &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; measures in place that parents can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for your time in reading this, please do whatever you can to inform those who have the ability to stop this what a monumentally bad idea this filter is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Forey&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Markpond: Why</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://markpond.com&quot;&gt;Markpond&lt;/a&gt;, a bookmarking website. I&amp;#39;m not going to lie, it&amp;#39;s similar to Pinboard. But I made Markpond as a challenge for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 15. I&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;got my whole life ahead of me&amp;quot;. So I figured why not make something that I use on a daily basis. That way, if something irritates me, I&amp;#39;ll be motivated to fix it. And if it fails, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markpond is not a startup. I&amp;#39;m not intending to make &lt;em&gt;that much &lt;/em&gt;money from it. I made it in the spirit of hacking - because I was motivated to make something that worked, and be able to point to it and say &amp;quot;I made that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a free service because I spent &lt;em&gt;a lot of &lt;/em&gt;time on it. The basic account if £5/year, and the archival account is £10/year. That&amp;#39;s not &lt;em&gt;that much&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s actually quite cheap. And best of all - you get a three-day free trial (in that you&amp;#39;re only charged on the third day of use), and so if you want to cancel your account before then, you can do so without incurring any loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you&amp;#39;re probably going to ask what Markpond does differently from all the services out there at the moment. Well, the answer is - not &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much. But it might do in the future. Right now, the only major difference is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.bergcloud.com/publications/11&quot;&gt;Little Printer publication&lt;/a&gt;, which is quite cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being a hacker, and a geek, I do like looking at pretty things. And if I&amp;#39;m going to use a site every single day, I&amp;#39;d like it to look nice. And I think I&amp;#39;ve done that without having an impact of the speed and overall responsiveness of the site. The front page of Markpond gets 89% from Google PageSpeed, compared to 84% for Pinboard and 70% for Kippt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying that PageSpeed is the only measure of how fast a site is, but Markpond&amp;#39;s good score is also a direct result of gzip compression coupled with Rails&amp;#39;s asset pipeline and using SVGs instead of normal images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed of Markpond isn&amp;#39;t just limited to the front-end though. The average server response time for a full profile page is around about 100ms, which is pretty damn good considering Markpond is run from a single Mac Mini.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - what am I saying here? Well, mostly that I don&amp;#39;t see why you can&amp;#39;t have a site that looks good while simultaneously being on average only 30ms slower than the current status quo. Some people will like the fact that Pinboard has a geeky interface with no images and the default font. But personally, I don&amp;#39;t - not for a site that I visit every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As so that, coupled with the project being a personal challenge, inspired me to create Markpond. I&amp;#39;m not looking for huge success - Markpond isn&amp;#39;t my full-time job - I&amp;#39;m still in school doing my GCSEs. But if there are similarly-minded people out there, I can&amp;#39;t see any harm in providing a service for them. So I have.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>little-commits</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;While rewriting Markpond, I thought it would be pretty cool if there was some way to track my progress through my roadmap of post-it notes. And so I took inspiration from one of the projects at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bergcloud.com/2013/03/05/berg-cloud-hack-day-number-two/&quot;&gt;Little Printer Hack Day 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alicebartlett/8528501770/in/pool-littleprinter&quot;&gt;GitHub Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mloughran&quot;&gt;Martyn Loughran&lt;/a&gt; and I looked into how I could make something using the Little Printer&amp;#39;s direct print API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I found out that GitHub has a thing called &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks&quot;&gt;WebHook URLs&lt;/a&gt;, which posts a dump of data every time someone pushes to a repository. So I made a little Sinatra app, reusing a bunch of code from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/littledropper&quot;&gt;something I did&lt;/a&gt; on the hack day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it receives a bunch of info from GitHub, formats it nicely, and then sends off another post request to BERGCloud to get it printed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had got this working locally, I pushed it up to Heroku and set it up as a service so that anybody can use it. You can find instructions &lt;a href=&quot;http://little-commits.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, every time I finish a little bit of the new Markpond, I get a printout and put it up on my roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/little-commits.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the source of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/little-commits&quot;&gt;little-commits&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. It&amp;#39;s really simple, but I think it&amp;#39;s quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>PayPal isn't doing itself any favours here</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Right. Let&amp;#39;s start out by going to their homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/paypal-1.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking nice enough. Finally, maybe they&amp;#39;ve fixed the awful site design from 2003 they had before. Oh wait. Let&amp;#39;s try logging in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/paypal-2.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope, I was wrong. It may look nice on the outside, but on the inside it&amp;#39;s exactly the same as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about the developer site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/paypal-3.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooh look. Isn&amp;#39;t that shiny. It says beta on it so it must be better. Let&amp;#39;s try signing in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/paypal-4.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that worked well enough. I even managed to create some Sandbox accounts after several bad request 401 failed attempts. Let&amp;#39;s click on the Sandbox site link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/paypal-5.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOPE! It&amp;#39;s gone. Completely. The UK one sometimes redirects to https://www.sandbox.paypal.co.uk, a domain that doesn&amp;#39;t exist on any DNS tables. Other times, it&amp;#39;s just 404ing. I even tried using a US proxy, and trying again to see if the US one was broken as well. Guess what? It was broken as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at the point of redesigning Markpond where I&amp;#39;m choosing a payment platform. If I possibly could, I would be running in the opposite direction right now. PayPal, a huge multinational company, has broken its developer site completely. And it looks like it&amp;#39;s been like that for the past few days. No service announcement, no public apology, just silently broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could, I would use &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;, which looks amazing. But, it&amp;#39;s US and Canada only for the foreseeable future. There&amp;#39;s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://braintreepayments.com&quot;&gt;Braintree&lt;/a&gt;, which has a nice functioning sandbox, but as far as I can tell requires a social security number to get your payment processing online, which of course I don&amp;#39;t have because I&amp;#39;m not a US citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s back to PayPal again. And for now, all the code I&amp;#39;m writing can&amp;#39;t be tested until I either put it in production and hope there aren&amp;#39;t any errors, or until I set up a second actual PayPal account, send some money over to it, and then try buying something back with it through the site. Great.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Perception - Short Film</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have finally, finally, got round to finishing an old project that started way back in May 2012. It&amp;#39;s my latest short film and I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be quite a long post, and before I show you the film (provided you haven&amp;#39;t already seen it), I thought it would be worth explaining a few things. There are also some things that I&amp;#39;m going to tell you &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;ve seen the film, to avoid spoiling things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So way back in May I&amp;#39;d just finished helping some older friends from my school (around 18, at the time I think). It was a one-day, 15-16-hour shoot all over west and slightly further west London, using a Sony FS100 and professional audio equipment owned by the school. I was 14 at the time and had not had that much fun making a film in ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they were about to leave our secondary school, St. Paul&amp;#39;s, to go off to college or wherever, and I was in my first year. There is nearly nobody in the 3 years in between us who is interested in filmmaking, and nobody actively doing anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it looked like that was going to be the most of filmmaking fun I would have for quite a while, until I was in the top years and was trusted with the best camera out of the school grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I set about rectifying the situation. Because I was the only one of my friends who was actively interested in making a film, it looked like I was going to have to write, direct and shoot it, and cast some of my friends appropriately and get some on the crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished the first draft of Perception on the 2nd May. Over the next two weeks, I asked friends and family to look over it, do iron out the details and get it polished. I&amp;#39;m not going to pretend that I&amp;#39;m &lt;em&gt;great &lt;/em&gt;at writing scripts, especially under time pressure as I knew we would have to have shot the whole film by the end of June. And what&amp;#39;s more - the film would have a £0 budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what came out of it was not a great script, but something to keep us going. Perhaps at this stage of my career, the goal is not to make a great film, but to learn a lot along the way and make mistakes that you&amp;#39;ll know not to make again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe, along with the fun that we had, that was what happened with this production. It&amp;#39;s not as good as I would have liked it to be, but we have to live realistically, and so I think it best to stop trying to improve this project more that is really possible, and to move onto the next, with fresh ideas and new perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, without further a-do, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/cinematicmob/perception&quot;&gt;here is the completed short&lt;/a&gt;. Please go and watch in Vimeo, and if you want to support me and my friends in our future work, consider &amp;#39;tipping&amp;#39; this film with the amount you think appropriate. The money will go towards new gear to help us improve and learn and make more awesome things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;#39;ve seen it, you might want to know a little more about how this was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I&amp;#39;d got the script completed, I asked my good friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://direthoughts.com&quot;&gt;Henry Dyer&lt;/a&gt; to help me produce the film. We set about creating a locations list: we were going to need to shoot in school, in a cinema, and on the street both during the day and after dark. However, the catch was that we&amp;#39;d have to have access to electricity in the place we&amp;#39;d shoot the final fight scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we emailed the local cinemas to see whether or not they&amp;#39;d consider allowing us to shoot in their lobby for free. I&amp;#39;d deliberately left out any scenes inside the cinema screen itself, as it would be much harder to get access and very unlikely without having to pay anything. Initially, we contacted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cineworld.co.uk/cinemas/30&quot;&gt;Cineworld Hammersmith&lt;/a&gt; because it was the cinema that looked the most like what I had in my head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cineworld.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they didn&amp;#39;t respond in the ~6 weeks we had before we needed to be actually needed to be shooting. Around a week or so after we asked them, we also contacted the good people at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electriccinema.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Electric Cinema&lt;/a&gt;, who were willing to let us borrow their lobby for around two hours for free. Unfortunately, when Henry went round there to see how we could film, it became apparent that it would be impossible for us to shoot the shots we had planned and that were critical to the plot. Also, around half an hour after Henry left, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/9321859/200-evacuated-after-blaze-at-historic-Notting-Hill-cinema.html&quot;&gt;it caught fire&lt;/a&gt;. So that was a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry had one last cinema up his sleeve, and that was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.curzoncinemas.com/cinemas/richmond/&quot;&gt;Curzon Cinema&lt;/a&gt; in Richmond. They were great and said that we could have the lobby for as long as we wanted as long as it was during opening hours and that we weren&amp;#39;t disturbing any performances. So we arranged to shoot there on the morning of Sunday 1st July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to do the shooting of the fight scene outside my house, as it would mean that we could get access to food, drink and most importantly power for the lights without buying a generator and catering services, and the other &amp;quot;walking scenes&amp;quot; as we referred to them, could be shot on the high street near my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting permission to film in school is always difficult, mainly because of excessive health and safety regulations, however it was made possible and a lot easier thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://preoccupations.org&quot;&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt; and Oliver Rokison, who helped us out a lot and got things organised, and supervised us after school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we had to decide what gear to use. Initially, we had thought that we might be able to shoot using the school&amp;#39;s FS100, but we would need to be supervised at all times to do that, and it turned out to be impractical. So we shot it on my 600D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had always been interested in Steadicam, especially having been the operator on the previous film I mentioned above, and I decided it would be the best way to film the walking scenes. Luckily, our school&amp;#39;s Art department had a Steadicam Merlin that we could borrow and use out of school, so we went for that. We borrowed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manfrotto.co.uk/video-kit-with-501hdv-head-525mvb-tripod-520ball-and-bag&quot;&gt;heavy duty tripod&lt;/a&gt; for the static shots, as it was by far the best tripod we had access to, and although it was quite heavy, it has a great fluid head. And finally, we were lucky enough to borrow some a set of three &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arri.com/lighting/lighting_emea/tungsten_lampheads/arrilite/arrilite_600.html&quot;&gt;ARRI 600&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; with barn doors, gels and stands. All of the lights in one bag with their paraphernalia were definitely the heaviest equipment we used - I estimate 12-15kgs, although we never bothered to weigh it. Many sore shoulders were had after carrying that monstrosity around. But it allowed us to shoot well into the night and have a decent light source with good colour, which is always a huge plus. Many thanks to Alan Newton from SPS Art for lending us the equipment and getting it all signed off for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of lenses, we used my Canon 50mm f/1.4 for most of the tripod shots, and my Sigma 20-40mm f/2.8 @20mm for all of the fight scene shots, and the other tripod shots. I used my 18-55m f/4-5.6 kit lens for the Steadicam shots, because it weighs next to nothing and has image stabilisation built in, which helped to get rid some of the jitters caused when flying the Merlin without the arm and vest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, for sound, we looked to the school&amp;#39;s Drama department. They have a RØDE NTG-2 with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?hl=en&amp;amp;q=Marantz+PMD661&amp;amp;bpcl=40096503&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;biw=1446&amp;amp;bih=932&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;cid=15825431444690287798&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=QgPqULSdJ6ur0AX60oDIAw&amp;amp;ved=0CEcQ8wIwAA&quot;&gt;Marantz PMD661&lt;/a&gt; and a boom pole, and we got Nathan, who regularly does technical theatre (backstage, lighting, etc.) with me and Henry in the Drama department, to record the audio for us. Again thanks to Edward Williams, head of Drama at SPS, for authorising us to borrow equipment, and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/theonlygolux&quot;&gt;Dan Staniforth&lt;/a&gt; for putting up with our unreasonable requests and unlocking the cupboards and getting us the forms to sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casting was difficult. In Year 9, it&amp;#39;s hard to find people who take you seriously when you say you&amp;#39;re making a film. But I also have a great friend, Amos Jackson, who agreed to act, who knew Ella, who also agreed.  Hugo was an old friend, and agreed to help me out, and Henry knew and persuaded Hilton to play the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. So hard in fact, that we didn&amp;#39;t know which roles anyone other than Hilton and Ella would be playing until 4 days before we started shooting. Nobody could be in the right place at the right time or stay long enough. Somehow though, we managed. And that&amp;#39;s one of the main difficulties about making a &lt;em&gt;truly &lt;/em&gt;independent film - you haven&amp;#39;t got a governing body, like a film school or film course or something to take care of scheduling for you and so you have to do all of that yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then the first day of shooting arrived. It was near the end of the summer term, and the holidays were just around the corner. It was the 15th June, and we shot the walking scene of Ella and Hilton, as well as the first half of the fight scene. I was intending to finish it that night, but that was going to be impossible as it was 9:30pm Hilton had to leave early and everyone had to get home, so I had to organize the second part of the scene to be shot later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a cold hair light, with a diffused orange backlight and key. That gave us some nice areas of shadow, that I could use to my advantage with the thugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/perception-1.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next shoot was the school scenes, and we did those on Tuesday 26th. The first bit was shot in our sports center, and I would have loved to do one of my long introductions with music and text, but I forgot to shoot a static locked-down shot and didn&amp;#39;t have time to come back later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have any proper storyboards, none that weren&amp;#39;t in my head, so I told the actors to perform the sequence of the turning corner and the mini-discussion with the friend and I filmed it from several angles to see which one looked best, and I&amp;#39;m quite happy with what came out of it. We put two of the 600W ARRIs at one end of the passage, bouncing off the ceiling, to fill out the shadows a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we moved up to the computer gallery. The challenging part with this room was that the whole wall on the right was reflective, meaning that anything we had behind the camera would also be in front of the camera if we weren&amp;#39;t careful. The tracking shot to the right as Hilton walks to his computer unfortunately included the reflections of Hugo holding a clapperboard, Nathan holding the boom pole, and one of the lights on its stand. It was too good to cut however, so I marked it down as needing some serious work in post.&lt;a href=&quot;http://newfangled.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-07-at-11.55.47.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[gallery type=&amp;quot;slideshow&amp;quot; link=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot; ids=&amp;quot;667,666,665&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual Facebook conversation on the screen wasn&amp;#39;t filmed until this month, basically down to a lack of time because of other projects I&amp;#39;d been working on, and Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of shooting was the day after school ended, the 1st of July. We had scheduled to film in and outside the Curzon in Richmond from about 10 in the morning. We arrived early so we could shoot the scene outside the cinema first. This scene was going to have to look like night, so we used a reflector to cancel out as many of the shadows as we could, so that I could colour grade later to make it look like night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/perception-2.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, nobody was there to open the cinema when the time came for us to shoot, so we waited. Then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ieshthapar.com/&quot;&gt;Iesh Thapar&lt;/a&gt;, one of the employees of the Curzon, who also makes short films, arrived, and it turned out that he also thought the cinema was going to open at around 10, but in reality it wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen until the first screening at around 11:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Nathan and Theo went round the corner to see if Tesco was open, but it was shut until 11. Eventually they found that Sainsbury&amp;#39;s in Richmond Station was open, and picked up as much as they could carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was quite worried at this point because the window for us to get our shots inside the cinema was closing, but luckily when Steve Forman, the manager arrived, he apologised and said we could shoot during one of the screenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more luckily for us, the screening was of a four-hour opera with an interval, so we had two hours to get in, set up, shoot and pack up before we started interrupting the paying audience. And with the help of Iesh, we managed with 20 minutes to spare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, Nathan was standing on one of the tables to get the audio we needed, unless that would have been in frame, and in that case he went under the counter of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/perception-3.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to thank Iesh for the help he gave us, and without him the mirror shot at the beginning of the interior scene would never have happened. He also helped as a clapper loader, which really helped to speed up proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had scheduled the scenes that we didn&amp;#39;t finish on the 15th for that evening, so many some of the cast and crew came home with me to spend the day, and others went off and returned later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening, at around 6pm, we started setting up the fight scene outside my house to look as much like the previous shoot as possible. But, to my dismay, the bulb of one of the three lights that we were going to use for the outside scenes blew, leaving us with only a two-light setup, which causes awkward shadows and overexposed areas. Luckily, I had two LED Par cans that were roughly half as bright as one of the ARRIs each, so I could get a match to what I had had previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/perception-4.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 7pm, we were all ready to shoot except for one person - Simran, who plays the lead, had had a minor family emergency and didn&amp;#39;t arrive until 8pm, having lost an hour of shooting time. It would have been fair to say I was fairly stressed at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Simran finally did arrive, we managed to get the remainder of the fight scene choreographed (yes that&amp;#39;s right - we hadn&amp;#39;t even had time to choreograph it properly yet) and shot it fairly quickly. Here&amp;#39;s an interesting fact - the noise Amos (Slide) makes when being punched in the stomach was not a sound effect, it was a real live recording of him falling to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light was fading fast, and most of the cast headed off home, except for the three thugs, because we still had to shoot their walking scene. It was around 10pm and people still had to get home, but we managed to get six takes of it. We must have been quite a sight - three thugs walking forwards with me walking backwards with a Steadicam and Nathan walking backwards holding a 3 meter boom pole trying not to get in the shot. And, right in front of us all, Henry, who walked into the road to make sure we weren&amp;#39;t going to get run over while crossing the road and not looking. Unfortunately we didn&amp;#39;t get a picture of that - we were all to concerned with getting the footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I&amp;#39;m very happy with the footage we got from that, and although the audio was not excellent, it was the best we could to with the equipment we had in the time we had. Maybe that&amp;#39;s the most anyone can ever do in situations like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was the end of principal photography. &amp;quot;A wrap&amp;quot;. A relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, on to editing. Here&amp;#39;s a brief screenlapse (I just made that term up but I quite like it) of the first stages of editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/56952303 &quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/56952303&quot;&gt;Editing Perception&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/alexforey&quot;&gt;Alex Forey&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I edit my films in Adobe Premiere Pro and do VFX in After Effects, by right-clicking a clip in the timeline and choosing &amp;quot;Replace with After Effects Composition&amp;quot;. This allows me to edit things in AE and have them automatically update in my timeline, so when I export that timeline, the whole movie is exported in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Magic Bullet Looks for colour correction and grading, and it&amp;#39;s the best piece of software I&amp;#39;ve come across for grading in the timeline. It&amp;#39;s fairly lightweight, but can occasionally go completely buggy on you, so you have to restart Premiere to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recorded some foley sound effects to supplement the live sound. Here is my setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/perception-5.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not ideal, and I don&amp;#39;t have a dedicated audio recorder so I record the sound into the camera, but it works. It&amp;#39;s on its side so that I can get the microphone close to the keyboard and so I can see the monitor through the camera, making it easier to sync up later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline itself was in 1920x1080, but I put a 2.35:1 (the aspect ratio that most films use) letterbox over the top as a guide to how to position things, as I would later export in that aspect ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between starting editing and finishing, I created a rough cut for the cast, crew and original composers of our score (who sadly got bogged down with work and were unable to complete it), and a second cut more recently for Henry so he could see how things were going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what the finished timeline looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/perception-timeline.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another perk of the post production job is that I got to make the fake Facebook accounts. We had initially created some when we shot the scene in the computer gallery, but had forgotten the passwords, so when it came round to shooting the chat windows, I had to make some more. Here is my desk with Jason&amp;#39;s Facebook on the left, mine in the middle, and Abbey&amp;#39;s on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/perception-6.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of them were friends with the cast and crew in real life, to make them more realistic. I roped in my sister to type on the other end of the chat while I filmed Jason&amp;#39;s side. I used an old HP monitor, which isn&amp;#39;t pictured above, because it was the closest I could find to the monitors we used at school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I&amp;#39;d done that, I dropped it into the timeline and we were about ready to go. I did a final audio pass, in which I went through and corrected some wonky levels (Premiere lets you do it while playing back the timeline, without pausing) and I deemed it ready to &amp;quot;ship&amp;quot;. I put the Cinematic Mob intro on the beginning and the ident on the end, and exported it in 1920x816, which is roughly 2.35:1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My specific settings were: H.264, 15mpbs, Level 5.1, 23.976fps, VBR 2-pass encoding with AAC 320kbps audio. The film, at 7 minutes and 37 seconds took 1 hour and 36 minutes to render on a 2010 iMac with quad-core i3 and 16GB of RAM, which isn&amp;#39;t too bad considering all the grading and stabilisation I used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One really cool thing that the whole Premiere Pro / Media Encoder suite can do for you is automatically upload your finished file over FTP, and it can even send the local file to the trash if you want it to. I used this to upload them to my home server, so that I could share it with Henry and a few others for review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing back the final product I realised that I&amp;#39;d entered someone&amp;#39;s name twice for the same thing in the credits, so I edited the Photoshop file, hit &amp;#39;reload footage&amp;#39; in After Effects, and then rendered Premiere sequence out again using the same settings as before in Media Encoder, this time overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, after uploading to Vimeo, that was that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go I&amp;#39;d just like to say a huge thank you to everyone involved, including the cast, crew, everyone at the Curzon and at St Paul&amp;#39;s for making this possible, and especially to my long-suffering parents, who had noisy children making a loud film outside their house until 10pm on two separate nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, it&amp;#39;s not perfect, far from it, but it was a great experience - I had a lot of fun, learnt a lot of things, and made some new good friends. Now, what&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Making Books from Pinboard or Markpond Bookmarks</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After learning Ruby, I recently re-discovered Tom Armitage&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/infovore/pinboard-bookmachine&quot;&gt;pinboard-bookmachine&lt;/a&gt;. This is a how-to on making books from your bookmarks, separated by year. I&amp;#39;ve always liked physical things - I used to love and still do my LEGO and K&amp;#39;NEX collections, and there&amp;#39;s nothing better than being able to touch a thing and say &amp;quot;I made that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the problems of only reading online content is that you can&amp;#39;t look at a physical bookshelf and say &amp;quot;look at all the things I&amp;#39;ve read&amp;quot;. Well, until around 10 months ago you couldn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, 10 months ago when I found out about this, I hadn&amp;#39;t the faintest idea how I would get this working. I&amp;#39;d never even installed Ruby before. So I&amp;#39;m trying to write the guide that I needed 10 months ago - here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to assume you&amp;#39;ve already got Ruby up and running, and if not, follow a decent guide for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby.about.com/od/beginningruby/ss/Installing-A-Ruby-Development-Environment-On-Windows.htm&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby.about.com/od/rubyversionmanager/ss/Installing-Ruby-On-Snow-Leopard-With-Rvm.htm&quot;&gt;OS X&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby.about.com/od/rubyversionmanager/ss/installrvmlinux.htm&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and you should be set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Download&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re going to need to download the code from the GitHub Repo somehow - whether you just download a ZIP of the repo, or you fork and clone it is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either use the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/infovore/pinboard-bookmachine&quot;&gt;pinboard-bookmachine&lt;/a&gt; by Tom, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/markpond-bookmachine&quot;&gt;markpond-bookmachine&lt;/a&gt; by me. My version will still work with Pinboard, but it includes some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/markpond-bookmachine/commit/59cdb99718bafb64a798c6ffd8546e87106b6651&quot;&gt;Markpond-specific changes&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/markpond-bookmachine/blob/59cdb99718bafb64a798c6ffd8546e87106b6651/models.rb#L40-44&quot;&gt;changing QR codes&lt;/a&gt; to be the archived URL instead of the normal URL if the bookmark has been archived, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/markpond-bookmachine/blob/master/lib/tasks/bookmachine.rake#L-34&quot;&gt;processing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/markpond-bookmachine/blob/master/views/year.haml#L-49&quot;&gt;displaying&lt;/a&gt; the via field on Markpond bookmarks. There&amp;#39;s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/markpond-bookmachine/commit/ea8df0e15d1d63a45a26413667e2bcd563916601&quot;&gt;one crucial fix&lt;/a&gt; that decodes HTML entities properly after they are encoded for the XML export, which stops you from getting random &amp;rsquo; strings everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose the one that applies the most to you. Chances are it&amp;#39;s pinboard-bookmachine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have bundler, then go ahead and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gembundler.com/&quot;&gt;install it&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re not sure if you do or not, chances are you don&amp;#39;t, so install it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up a terminal window, and navigate to the root of your project. For me, it is &lt;code&gt;~/Code/pinboard-bookmachine&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;bundle install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any errors, Google them, but everything should go fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create Database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the same terminal window, run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;rake db:migrate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you should notice that a file called development.db appears in your folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fill Database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you need to go and get your bookmarks. If you&amp;#39;re using Markpond, log in and go to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;https://markpond.com/core/actions/export?format=pinboard
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re using Pinboard, go to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;https://api.pinboard.in/v1/posts/all
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And copy the contents. If you&amp;#39;re doing this in a browser, you&amp;#39;re going to want to right-click and view source to make sure you get only the XML. Copy all of it to your clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, make a folder called &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;, and in that, make a file called &lt;code&gt;pinboard_all.xml&lt;/code&gt;. Paste your bookmarks into that file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same terminal window that you used earlier, simply run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;rake
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll see a load of text flying by as your bookmarks are imported into the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preview your book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the terminal window, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;rackup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then go to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:9292&lt;/code&gt; and click on the years to see what will be printed. Take note of the first year listed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Customise it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll have noticed that the names and details are still Tom Armitage&amp;#39;s, so you&amp;#39;ll want to change them. To do so, go into &lt;code&gt;views/year.haml&lt;/code&gt; and edit the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the volumes number to be correct, go into &lt;code&gt;models.rb&lt;/code&gt; and change 2004 on line 5 to the first year of your bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Make the PDFs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re satisfied with everything, go back into terminal and run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;rake publish:all
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to publish all of the years, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;rake publish:year YEAR=1999
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to publish just your bookmarks from 1999 (for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Make the Book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using Lulu, like Tom did, because I can&amp;#39;t find anywhere else online that has an interface that I understand. You&amp;#39;ll have to do the next bit for each book, because I can&amp;#39;t find a way to batch-create them. All you need to do is make an account, then go &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/publish/books/?cid=nav_bks&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and click &amp;#39;Start Publishing&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, you&amp;#39;ll want to select &amp;#39;Make a Paperback Book&amp;#39;, give it a working title, and select &amp;#39;Standard&amp;#39; paper and &amp;#39;U.S. Trade&amp;#39; size (6&amp;quot; x 9&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then upload the first PDF that you made (note the progress bar doesn&amp;#39;t work - don&amp;#39;t worry, your book is being uploaded. The page will refresh a couple of times, and click next until you get to the cover design page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either use their wizard, but I&amp;#39;d prefer to make my own. If you do as well, click the &amp;#39;Advanced One-Piece Cover&amp;#39; above the Flash widget. Then, if you have Photoshop, &lt;a href=&quot;http://newfangled.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cover.psd&quot;&gt;download this template&lt;/a&gt; and edit it according to the dimensions they tell you, and change the text, otherwise you can make your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save that Photoshop document out as a &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; and upload it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only started collecting bookmarks in August 2012, so my book is only 203 pages long. In the format I&amp;#39;ve mentioned above, this edition will cost me £4.60 + shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, on balance, seems extremely reasonable, especially with a savvy use of coupon codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/markpond-book.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go. Hopefully a guide that even the programming-illiterate can follow. As always, if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Installing MAMP and Rails on a Mac</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a Mac laptop, I thought that I&amp;#39;d go about setting everything up that I&amp;#39;d need to code in my favourite programming languages - PHP and Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is not for the faint of heart, so continue at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Install MAMP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the easy part. Download MAMP from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and install it like you would with any other application. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will install Apache, MySQL and PHP. If you went for MAMP Pro, like I did, it&amp;#39;s really simple to add new projects. Just go into the control panel, click on the hosts tab, and add a new one with a document root of wherever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Install XCode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to continue, you&amp;#39;re going to need to install XCode. You can get it for free from the Mac App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve got the program installed, you&amp;#39;re also going to need to install XCode command line tools. Do that by going opening XCode, then going to Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go to the Downloads tab, and within that the Components tab. Find the &amp;quot;Command Line Tools&amp;quot; entry, and click install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what it should look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/xcode-install.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.5. Install Homebrew&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have &lt;a href=&quot;http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; already installed, you really should do. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m not putting it as a full step. It&amp;#39;s a simple package manager for OS X, like aptitude for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;ruby -e &amp;quot;$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Install Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although OS X already comes with Ruby, it&amp;#39;s usually not up-to-date. To fix this, we&amp;#39;re going to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://rvm.io/&quot;&gt;RVM&lt;/a&gt; to install a new version over the old one. This will mean that we will not upset any of the core functionality of OS X (or something).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go into Terminal and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will install RVM and the latest version of Ruby (in my case 1.9.3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Update gem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure everything from now on goes smoothly, you&amp;#39;ll want to update the gem package manager. To do this, paste this into the terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;sudo gem update --system
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Install Rails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Rails is only a gem, installing it is extremely simple. Just run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;sudo gem install rails
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will also install a bunch of other gems that are dependencies of Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. Install MySQL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re probably wondering why I&amp;#39;m installing MySQL, even though we installed it earlier with MAMP. The reason is that the mysql2 gem that is needed for Rails to talk to MySQL will not install without this version present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;brew install mysql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should get you up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Install mysql2 gem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; installation of MySQL, you can go ahead and install the mysql2 gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;sudo gem install mysql2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: don&amp;#39;t install the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; gem, as it is outdated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. Switch back to the old MySQL install&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;#39;ve got the gem installed it&amp;#39;s safe to switch your console back to using the MAMP MySQL server. Simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;sudo nano /etc/paths
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And add this line to the top of the document&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And restart the terminal. Now, running the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; command will point to the MAMP installation, which is the one you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;re done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Creating a Rails App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to create a new Rails app, &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the place where you want to put your projects. In my case it was &lt;code&gt;~/Sites&lt;/code&gt;. Then run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;rails new app_name -d mysql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the last thing you&amp;#39;ll want to do is go into &lt;code&gt;config/database.yml&lt;/code&gt; and change the file by replacing the sockets with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, create the databases needed by your app manually, because Rails won&amp;#39;t do it for you. You can use the phpMyAdmin build into MAMP to do this, but I prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sequelpro.com/&quot;&gt;Sequel Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is free and awesome, and a native Mac App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test out your new Rails app by &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;ing to your app&amp;#39;s root, then running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;rails s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And (hopefully) all should be well. If it isn&amp;#39;t, feel free to leave your problems in the comments and I&amp;#39;ll see if I can help.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>PHP Little Printer Framework</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s what it says on the tin, really - a framework to make making Little Printer publications faster and easier in PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes ETag support, as well as automatically generating the meta.json and validate_config endpoints based on the fields you define in config.php.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/PHP-LittlePrinter&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>GIFs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In a vague attempt to try to organise my growing GIF collection, I set up a large chain of actions to take a URL of a GIF and upload it to my new bukkit-style site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gif.alexforey.com&quot;&gt;gif.alexforey.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I browse most of the GIFs in my life on Reddit, though Alienblue, and the easiest method of sharing the URL of the GIF is to email  it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whenever I want to save a GIF, I email myemail+gifs@alexforey.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email&amp;#39;s subject is the description I want to give my GIF, and the body is the URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s a filter in Gmail that takes any email sent to myemail+gifs@alexforey.com and gives it the label of &amp;#39;gif&amp;#39;, and archives it (&amp;quot;skipping the inbox&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then have an IFTTT recipe to take new emails with the label &amp;#39;gif&amp;#39;, and save them to Dropbox, with the file name being the description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have Dropbox Automator upload any new files in that Dropbox folder via FTP to gif.alexforey.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bit hacky, but it works, and it&amp;#39;s quite a neat system, until I can think of something better.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Quite enough Raspberry Pi for One Day</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know I started a website that runs from two Raspberry Pis. Today, it is my sad duty to tell you that it now only runs from one Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because while shifting around some ethernet cables under my desk, I accidentally pulled one that was attached to Hercule, my main Raspberry Pi with the entirety of Markpond on it. It hit against the inside of my Lego case, and snapped the SD card slot and splintered my SD card. Both of these, it is fair to say, pissed me off a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to keep Markpond up and running, I quickly took the slightly broken SD card and taped it into Sherlock, which luckily could boot from it successfully. I then (very) carefully put it in an iMac and made a &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; backup of it, which took 4 hours, because it was a 16GB card. Finally I put it back into Sherlock, booted it, and changed the DCHP reservations on my router so that what was Sherlock is now Hercule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have one functioning Raspberry Pi and one broken one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried basically everything to try to get the (now) Sherlock to boot (superglue, tape, the lot), but all I get is that one red light. But the other problem is that I do remember that this one used to have problems booting even when it did have a fully functioning SD card reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s a problem with the Raspberry Pi itself. There &lt;em&gt;is no standard&lt;/em&gt;, or there wasn&amp;#39;t any when I bought them. So I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s the power supply that isn&amp;#39;t supplying the needed 5v and 700mA, or that the card is physically broken, or the SD reader that&amp;#39;s physically broken, or the OS on the card that it can&amp;#39;t boot from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And much of the help online is speculation - &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never had this problem but if I did this is what I&amp;#39;d try&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s all very well giving advice, but not very helpful if you have that problem. Stackexchange launched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; site to try and combat this problem, but questions such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/3476/how-to-return-a-faulty-device&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; come along far too often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s more than just my personal problems with this - everyone is going to have problems like these sooner or later. The Guardian &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/nov/04/raspberry-pi-programming-jam-cern?CMP=twt_gu&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are enthusiatic about it mostly because they hope its price, size, software and sturdiness (you can shove it in your pocket without damaging it, supposedly) will make it appeal to kids, and thus lead children into computer programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s simply &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; robust enough for schools yet. If half a millimetre of broken plastic can render an entire unit worthless, how is it going to fare in the hands of over-enthusiastic 8-year-olds, or under-enthusiastic teenagers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another thing that people (adults, in particular) don&amp;#39;t seem to understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;embed tweet&#39;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does no-one understand that you can’t teach kids to code? If they’re interested, they’re interested, but if they’re not there’s no point&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alex Forey (@alexforey) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexforey/statuses/265052314665107456&quot;&gt;November 4, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, you can&amp;#39;t simply &amp;quot;lead children into computer programming&amp;quot;, like you can&amp;#39;t force someone to do a sport they don&amp;#39;t like. They&amp;#39;ll build up resentment that they have to do it, and because it doesn&amp;#39;t appeal to them, they won&amp;#39;t give it a chance and they&amp;#39;ll hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one more intrinsic problem with the Raspberry Pi - it&amp;#39;s moving faster than Apple products. And by that I mean every week or so there&amp;#39;s a new OS update, and every few months a new piece of hardware comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;embed tweet&#39;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With new boards and new OS versions, it&amp;#39;s a job to keep up with how to do things with a Raspberry Pi. + most net answers are just reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Chris Heathcote (@antimega) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antimega/statuses/247978032625750016&quot;&gt;September 18, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is no documentation, there is no standard &lt;/em&gt;because updates come out faster than people can keep up with them, faster than people can write documentation for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, stop &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2180&quot;&gt;adding more RAM&lt;/a&gt;, and, if you must make a new version of the board, design it better. Have you ever tried to hold something square with sharp corners and wires sticking out of all four sides of it, let alone put it on a desk without having cables pulling it off the desk? Yes, it would add to the expense, but why can&amp;#39;t you just move all the cables &lt;em&gt;to one side?&lt;/em&gt; Why can&amp;#39;t to design it so the SD card doesn&amp;#39;t stick out the back of it, waiting to be dropped on or broken?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I guess the last thing is, the GUI sucks. More than sucks, it&amp;#39;s uninviting, slow, buggy and just generally awful. And that&amp;#39;s why I only run my Raspberry Pis as servers. Because, if you can get them to boot, they&amp;#39;re robust and awesome as being servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in being good as servers, and bad at GUI, you&amp;#39;ve defeated the point of the Raspberry Pi as being a good tool for education and a good computer to learn to code on, because you either can&amp;#39;t afford or don&amp;#39;t want to spend the money on a laptop/desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, in order to use the Raspberry Pi as a server, you have to have &lt;em&gt;clients&lt;/em&gt;. Clients to do the code writing on, clients to connect to the web server, clients to connect to the media server. As you may or may not know, I wrote the code for Markpond on my laptop, and then used SFTP to shuttle it onto the Raspberry Pis, where it could be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;#39;t do that if you didn&amp;#39;t have a laptop/desktop/other computer which you had access to. And that other computer, no matter how old or broken, will still be a better coding experience than coding on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would much, much rather pay £10 extra for a well-designed and robust board, with a metal SD slot and nicely aligned ports, than have a tiny piece of fragile plastic that renders the entire unit useless if broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I want? A standard. Because there is so much untested. That&amp;#39;s not to say that the Raspberry Pi doesn&amp;#39;t have a great community surrounding it, it does - but it has an inexperienced community. It&amp;#39;s almost impossible to be an expert in the Raspberry Pi. I want a definitive list of SD cards that &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;work, a definitive list of power supplies that &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;work, a well-built board and well-designed board, but most of all, a board with up-to-date, easy to understand for people less experienced than me, and well-written documentation. Something, that at the moment, the Raspberry Pi is sadly lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>This Happened #12 Videos Online</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I probably should have written about this before, but I guess I&amp;#39;m disorganised like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way back in May (does&amp;#39;t that feel like a long time ago(!)) I filmed the series of &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thishappened.org/events/london-12&quot;&gt;This Happened&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; talks at the V&amp;amp;A for the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;http://designswarm.com&quot;&gt;Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino&lt;/a&gt; - and just recently (as far as I know) they&amp;#39;ve been released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here they are, in order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/49791007 &quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/49852474 &quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s one thing that I wasn&amp;#39;t satisfied by it was the sound, and I managed to fix this issue when I filmed the next set (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thishappened.org/events/london-13&quot;&gt;London #13&lt;/a&gt;) with the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://preoccupations.org&quot;&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s amazing radio microphone. I&amp;#39;ve just finished editing those talks, and I&amp;#39;ll post them here when they go online.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools of Markpond</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some people have expressed interest as to what software / hardware went into building &lt;a href=&quot;http://markpond.com/&quot;&gt;Markpond&lt;/a&gt;, my bookmarking site. So, for those interested, here you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Development Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote Markpond on &lt;a href=&quot;http://sublimetext,com/2&quot;&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/a&gt;, which is an amazing IDE. I save the scripts to my Dropbox folder, which has a Git Repository in it. That way I can code a little bit and have it saved automagically into the cloud, and once I&amp;#39;ve finished a big section I commit the code to the repository, and push that repo to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitbucket.org&quot;&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt;. So I always have a working copy of the files (synced according to time saved) in Dropbox, and a code history tracking changes over time in Bitbucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I&amp;#39;ve got a working version, I upload the files from my Dropbox over SFTP to the testing part of the live server with FileZilla, which sits behind a firewall and password protection, but connects to the same database host as the live version. That way I can test out new code additions in a working environment without affecting the live site at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if I&amp;#39;m satisfied with how the code is working, I&amp;#39;ll write a post and save it as a draft on Tumblr, which hosts the blog, upload the new code to the live server, test it out, and then publish the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Server Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markpond runs from an Apache2 web server, with PHP, MySQL Server, MySQL Client, mod_rewrite, Pear and a few other packages installed. The SFTP server is the same as the default SSH server that comes with the Raspberry Pi. I have also installed phpMyAdmin, which is a back-end database admin panel. phpMyAdmin sits above the web root of Markpond, so there&amp;#39;s no point digging around to see if you can find the URL of it. All of that&amp;#39;s on the first Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one runs Apache2 with PHP, and a MySQL client. It&amp;#39;s main function is to run PHP scripts via Cron Jobs in Rasp[De]bian. This can be broken down into several levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHP Scripts to Archive and Mirror&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Database logging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archive Engine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence the PHP Scripts call the database logging scripts and also run wget which is the Linux program that actually does the archiving. It&amp;#39;s all quite complicated and really I need a diagram to explain it, but as long as I understand it in my head everything should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two Raspberry Pis share resources over Samba, the same program that allows computer-to-computer file sharing in Windows and Mac. Some of the scripting is shared across servers, as well as some of the asset files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware really is quite simple. There are two Raspberry Pis (Hercule and Sherlock), sitting on a larger network but next to each other on a switch, meaning the time for network traffic to move between the two is &amp;lt; 10 milliseconds. The switch itself is a regular TP-Link 10/100mbps one, and not gigabit because the most the ethernet adapters on the two Raspberry Pis support is 10/100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The archives are stored on a 32GB memory stick that is auto-mounted on the Sherlock, and has a transfer rate of around 40mbps. When you visit an archived page, it is being served by Apache on Hercule, but using files shared by Samba on Sherlock. Again, a diagram is probably needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/markpond-network.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Network and DNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domain of Markpond points to Cloudflare&amp;#39;s nameservers. Then using A records, it is pointed to the most recent IP of the servers. Each subdomain is a CNAME record set as an alias of markpond.com, and then I use Apache VirtualHosts to point you to the correct part of Markpond, with the exception of blog. and status., which are pointed at Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because BT doesn&amp;#39;t give out static public IP addresses any more, I also have another cron PHP script that periodically checks the current IP address, checks it against what it was 5 minutes ago, and if it has changed it pings Cloudflare&amp;#39;s API to update the main A record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a bit of a techie post, but I&amp;#39;m only just getting started with Markpond. I actually am working on Mirroring for Readability and Instapaper - but if only they used anything except OAuth 1.x!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Little Printing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, I went to the first of &lt;a href=&quot;http://berglondon.com&quot;&gt;BERG&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s Little Printer &lt;a href=&quot;http://bergcloud.com/2012/09/27/school-report/&quot;&gt;After School&lt;/a&gt; Clubs, or as Alice put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;embed tweet&#39;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice&amp;#39;s after hours party time is now in session. BONNNNNG.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alice Bartlett (@alicebartlett) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alicebartlett/statuses/251003461125165056&quot;&gt;September 26, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great fun, and I got to meet some interesting people in person, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexmuller&quot;&gt;Alex Muller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hailpixel.com/&quot;&gt;Devin Hunt&lt;/a&gt;,  and a few others. In short, I talked to lots of people, wrote lots of code, and ate too much pizza. I could get used to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the title of this post is Little Printing, so I guess that&amp;#39;s what I intended to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing for the Little Printer is harder than you think - because it is a mix of mediums. You are designing for print, so it&amp;#39;s print design - but you have to use the code of web design to achieve it. So that&amp;#39;s one factor of designing your publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, along with content, is enough to make a publication. But to make a &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;publication, you have to think about where the reader will be reading your publication, and hence what access to other things they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no point making a publication that is designed for the morning, but required scissors because you will most likely be reading it on the tube - where you won&amp;#39;t have access to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no point making a publication that is designed for the morning, but required access to the internet because you might also be reading it on the tube, where there is no WiFi or 3G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you get where I&amp;#39;m going here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to think about the environment your reader will be in, as well as what content might be useful to them, where to get it, and designing and creating assets for the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, bearing this in mind, I have created no less than two publications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of which is for &lt;a href=&quot;http://markpond.com&quot;&gt;Markpond&lt;/a&gt;, my bookmarking website. You can choose to print out either your two most recent bookmarks, or two random bookmarks from your history. I think the latter is much more fun, as you can look back in time and find out what you were reading, and your results will be different every time. You also have the choice of including today&amp;#39;s popular bookmark, although I still need to do some work on the algorithm that chooses that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what that one looks like on screen (@ 100% zoom):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/little-markpond-1.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now in reality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/little-markpond-2.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll notice the QR codes. People seem to have collected this hatred of them - but I still quite like them. I don&amp;#39;t like it when they&amp;#39;re using in stupid ways by advertising agencies, but I do like the idea of being able to encode a digital link into a real life object, and being able to convert it back to digital whenever I want to. It saves you the time and effort of having to type the URL back into your tiny smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that struck me was just how &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;the Little Printer prints. That sounds obvious, but when you view the same publication on a screen it is at least twice the width and height of its real-life counterpart. And hence your font-sizing is all wrong, the spacing is uneven, and it just looks a bit off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the point of these Little Printer After School Clubs - to be able to see your publication in real life before anyone else does. The most accurate you can get online is by using BERG&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://remote.bergcloud.com/developers/tools/&quot;&gt;Rapid Prototyper&lt;/a&gt;, but even then the fonts aren&amp;#39;t quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway my second publication was &lt;em&gt;On This Day (in History)&lt;/em&gt;, and is basically just what it says. It can either pull from the BBC&amp;#39;s On This Day Feed (which used to work, but now doesn&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m fixing it), or the Wikipedia one. The BBC feed is more old-current affairs, and the Wikipedia one is more historical events (battles, that sort of thing). So you can choose what you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo/onthisday&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, so if you want you can have a poke around, and see how I structure my publications in PHP. The publication for Markpond is structured in almost exactly the same way, except that it also has to dive right into the core function files of Markpond to go and get bookmarks, generate QR codes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t wait to see what other people do with the Little Printer, an I&amp;#39;m really excited for it&amp;#39;s release some time in November. Hopefully both my publications will be on the starting line-up when Little Printers start arriving in homes. I guess the only problem is that I can&amp;#39;t afford one (yet), so let&amp;#39;s just sit tight and see what the Raspberry Pi Summer Coding Competition Judges think of Markpond.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Well this was unexpected</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t usually blog about small things - but since I updated iCloud control panel in Windows this has popped up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/photostream.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It behaved rather bizarrely, and appears to have a system path of Computer\Photo Stream. No proper file path or anything, it&amp;#39;s just appeared. I&amp;#39;m not even sure if it &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;a folder - it might be an empty folder that is filled with not-actual-files by the iCloud Control Panel, and when I copy a file from the folder, it simply downloads it from iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be interested if anyone could explain how this works.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A New Design and More</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t blogged in quite a while, mainly because I&amp;#39;ve been so busy. But here I am again, and I thought it was time for a new design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Film and Stuff was one year old a few days ago, and I thought it was time for a refresh. I went searching through the Wordpress Theme and found this one, which I think suits me quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bergcloud.com&quot;&gt;Little Printer&lt;/a&gt; recently and that, along with Markpond and the new school year, has kept be very busy. I&amp;#39;m going to be writing a post very soon in full about both Markpond and Little Printer separately, but you&amp;#39;ll have to make do with this for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two more things though - I&amp;#39;ve recently started actually using GitHub, and I&amp;#39;m rather pleased with my username. It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alfo&quot;&gt;alfo&lt;/a&gt;, which must be have been one of the only 4-character usernames left when I signed up last November, but better still it&amp;#39;s actually relevant to my name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last thing is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortr.us&quot;&gt;The Fortrus&lt;/a&gt; has been grudgingly resuscitated, and I&amp;#39;m now writing there, as well as here and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.markpond.com&quot;&gt;Markpond Blog&lt;/a&gt;. So if things seem a bit quiet, you can always hop over to one of those to make sure I haven&amp;#39;t died yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you soon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Making the Raspberry Pi Useful, Internship at Firefly and Big Post-It Notes</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/big-post-its.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I&amp;#39;ve had a couple of Raspberry Pis for a while now, and I hadn&amp;#39;t got round to using them to their full extent. Here&amp;#39;s a list of reasons why not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have two memory cards. One of them works with Raspberry Pis, and one that doesn&amp;#39;t. So I (still) can&amp;#39;t use my second Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t quite sure what I wanted to do with them. After I installed Plex Media Server on &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmandstuff.co.uk/475-diy-home-server&quot;&gt;my main server&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to install Raspbmc; but I ran into problems, again. For some reason, RC1 and RC2 wouldn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href=&quot;http://raspbmc.com&quot;&gt;Raspbmc.com&lt;/a&gt; went down for ages and ages. In fact it only &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raspbmc.com/2012/07/welcome-back/&quot;&gt;came back up&lt;/a&gt; three days ago. And so I couldn&amp;#39;t test out RC3, and I&amp;#39;ve decided to wait until official release anyway, so I get a stable version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I was making a film, and I&amp;#39;ll write about that soon. I&amp;#39;ve  nearly finished &lt;em&gt;arranging the footage in the timeline&lt;/em&gt; after a whole week of editing. Considering we filmed an average of five takes per shot, and there were &lt;em&gt;a lot of shots&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I started my week of internship at &lt;a href=&quot;http://fireflysolutions.co.uk&quot;&gt;Firefly Solutions&lt;/a&gt; in Hammersmith. Everyone there was very nice and welcoming, and I really felt at home there. But the long and the short of it was that I needed a mini testing server, and decided that the Raspberry Pi fitted the bill perfectly. So I installed Apache2 and PHP so I could do dynamic pages, and set it to log in automatically and start itself up as soon as power is plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means I can find a spare ethernet port, plug it in, and then do an IP scan from my laptop, find its IP address, and then FTP all the files to it. Of course, I do actually already have WAMP on my laptop, but this is &lt;em&gt;way more cool&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure if I&amp;#39;m allowed to talk about what I actually did at Firefly, and so I won&amp;#39;t, but it was very interesting. But one cool thing I saw there were MASSIVE sticky notes. And so now I have some. And so now I will use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of projects entering their final stages now, so prepare for a flood of posts as they get completed and I get round to documenting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, see you on the interwebs.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Repurpose an Old Computer into a DIY Complete Home Server for Free</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a while since I&amp;#39;ve had an utter geek-out, and I thought it&amp;#39;s about time for another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may know that I&amp;#39;ve had a motherboard &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/p/jJMNd/&quot;&gt;hanging on my bedroom wall &lt;/a&gt;for a couple of months, but recently I realized this was a big mistake. It was perfectly functional! So I dug around in my wardrobe and eventually found the box that contained the other components from our family&amp;#39;s old, gutted computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I roughly re-assembled it, with IDE cables going to 2x DVD Drives and the HDD, as well as supplying power to everything to the PSU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hesitantly, I connected the power supply. A message appeared on the screen saying the CPU Fan had failed, and it promptly shut itself down. I spent five or so minutes borrowing looking for the connector for the fan, and eventually found it. I reconnected the PSU and the monitor lit up - it (kinda) worked! It used to be an old Windows XP Box - this is what it looked like at this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/diy-server-1.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got out the original casing, ripped out the bits I didn&amp;#39;t need, and roughly assembled the guts back into the frame. Then it looked roughly like this (and please don&amp;#39;t yell at me about cable management...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/diy-server-2.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went over to the iMac, burned a disk of Ubuntu 12.04 (not the server version, because I like GUIs and it&amp;#39;s not like the server&amp;#39;s going to have its work cut out), and slammed it into one of the DVD drives. I connected my old crappy PS2 Keyboard and mouse (the ones that don&amp;#39;t need drivers), and moved that drive to first in the boot list in the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old hard drive formatted, and a shiny new install of Ubuntu. Then I went about installing everything I could possibly need to make this into a fully featured home server beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost I installed Apache, PHP, MySQL (pronounced My Squirrel), and PHPMyAdmin by following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_lamp_for_newbies&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. Once I had done this, I performed a chmod to allow me to write to &lt;code&gt;/var/www&lt;/code&gt; from other programs, which is the web home directory. There was only one problem - basic modules like cURL, that allow you to make HTTP requests right from your scripts, were not installed. After a bit of Google-ing I found that the terminal command is as simple as &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install php5-curl&lt;/code&gt;. Ran that and now everything&amp;#39;s going great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I installed proftpd, a great FTP server, and along side that a GUI - the one you get in the Ubuntu Software Centre. I set up two FTP accounts, one to access my web home directory, and another to access my personal account - including my desktop and documents folders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went about turning it into a mini-NAS server. I connected a few large USB HDDs, and then followed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.7tutorials.com/how-access-ubuntu-shared-folders-windows-7&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; about setting up SMB sharing to Windows and therefore the Mac computers on our network. Everything&amp;#39;s going great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing - I installed forked-daapd, an iTunes music server, while following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrericsir.com/blog/technology/setting-up-ubuntu-as-an-itunes-music-server/&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, and set its save location to another large USB HDD. Now whenever I open iTunes on any of the computers on my network, that Server shows up and I can drag and drop files into either an iTunes window, or a Finder view of the shared HDD. The clever thing about the second method is that forked-daapd will automatically transcode ogg and flac files into WAVs, which iTunes likes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing I did, to preparation for installing my server in the basement without a monitor, keyboard or mouse, was to install a remote desktop server for Ubuntu. I decided on xrdp because of the quick install, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it as development has fallen behind, and so it does not work completely with the Remote Desktop Connection client in Windows 7. The most it can do is open terminal windows by using CTRL+ALT+T. In the near future I intend to replace this by using the default in-built VNC server in Ubuntu and installing TightVNC on Windows, or the equivalent on Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that BT does not offer Static IP Addresses. To get round that, I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnsdynamic.org&quot;&gt;DNSDynamic&lt;/a&gt;. They provide an easy to use API for updating the IP address that your subdomain points to. And to that effect, I set up a Cron Job (with &lt;code&gt;crontab -e&lt;/code&gt; to trigger a PHP script that sends the server&amp;#39;s most recent IP address to DNSDynamic, every day at midnight. The code that goes in that section looks like this: &lt;code&gt;* * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O /dev/null http://localhost/path/to/php.php&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the code for that PHP file to update the dynamic servers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php
      $ip = file_get_contents(&amp;quot;http://myip.dnsdynamic.org&amp;quot;);&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      $username = &amp;quot;YOUR_USERNAME&amp;quot;;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      $password = &amp;quot;YOUR_PASSWORD&amp;quot;;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      $website = &amp;quot;YOUR_DOMAIN&amp;quot;;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;

      $request = file_get_contents(&amp;quot;https://&amp;quot;.$username.&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;.$password.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
         &amp;quot;@www.dnsdynamic.org/api/?hostname=&amp;quot;.$website.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;myip=&amp;quot;.$ip);&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
 ?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one last thing. I installed the OpenSSH Server, to allow me to perform command line operations from other computers. This is done simply by running &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client&lt;/code&gt;, and you&amp;#39;re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only things left to do were to install it in the basement, providing Internet to it over Ethernet via TP-Link power plugs; and forward ports 80 (for web), 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH) and 3389 (Remote Desktop) to the server from the router and I was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing looks like this -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/diy-server-3.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure what I&amp;#39;ll end up doing with this machine, but I&amp;#39;m sure it will be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Transport for London: Timelapse</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, it&amp;#39;s timelapse, not time-lapse or time lapse. I don&amp;#39;t care about your opinion of this matter. And with that, I can move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had decided a while ago that although my previous timelapses (&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/alexforey/southbank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/alexforey/bath&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/alexforey/laidinearth&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/alexforey/clouds&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) were interesting, I would like to make something to showcase London, which is, in my opinion (which, let&amp;#39;s face it, is the only one that matters here), the greatest city on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do something that showcased what an _awesome _(in the literal sense of the word) city London really is. I originally intended to concentrate just on the tube, but after reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/5225.aspx&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://photographernotaterrorist.org/&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pentaxuser.co.uk/forum/topic/taking-photos-on-london-underground--23192&quot;&gt;discussions &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/london_tube/discuss/72157603883052240/&quot;&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/londinium/discuss/72157605810327927/&quot;&gt;discussions &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/metrosdelmundo/discuss/72157594185847631/&quot;&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.petapixel.com/2010/10/14/forced-to-delete-photos-no-problem-just-recover-them-later/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PetaPixel+%28PetaPixel%29&amp;amp;utm_content=Google+Reader&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; and worrying, I eventually realized that was not going to be entirely possible, so I shifted from just the Tube to Transport in London in general, knowing that there would be more opportunity for footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d abide by the official rules, no tripods or flash, and go and set up anyway. If I was stopped then meh, I&amp;#39;d move onto the next station, and if not well that&amp;#39;s fine then. Another rule that I felt abliged to follow (although in reality is completely useless) was the rule that you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;not allowed to take photos in stations if you spend more than 15 minutes there&amp;quot;. This was basically their definition of the difference between taking photos as you pass through, like so many tourists do; and setting out to a station to take photos, not ride the tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I had to plan beforehand was the music. This was basically a no-brainer, because the music had to be CC-licenced, yet also be awesome. I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://soundcloud.com/patrickreza/m83rmx&quot;&gt;this track&lt;/a&gt; while watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98EvwIGFB7s&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, and after searching around a bit I found out he was happy to let me use his music. It also had a certain flow to it that I couldn&amp;#39;t find anywhere else, so that was that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went about planning my shots. Here&amp;#39;s an early previs of what I thought it was going to turn out like, but in the end I ended up editing what I had, then planning in my head what footage I needed to fill the gaps in the song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so with that, I went out to get my footage. I went to Piccadilly Circus (the place and the Tube Station), the Mall, Hammersmith, Windsor, Earl&amp;#39;s Court, Trafalgar Square and Turnham Green station, over the course of about a month, in around 5 trips. At the end of each trip I&amp;#39;d bring back the footage, process it with Media Encoder CS5, put it into Premiere CS5.5, match up the footage to the appropriate part of the film, wrote down the length of the gaps and what kind of subject would fit that part in the music, and go out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my last shoot, which was (funilly enough) the last shots of the film (traffic at night around the Hammersmith Flyover), a construction van pulled up to just behind where I was filming. Two guys got out and went over to the part of the flyover that had roadworks on it, and I assumed they were just checking that everything was in order. A few minutes later I turn round to see them both watching me. They were slightly perplexed as to what the hell I was doing with an expensive camera on a tripod in the cold and dark by myself. I turned round and pretended to ignore them. But a few seconds later one of them was standing next to me and asked me what I was doing. It wasn&amp;#39;t an accusatory &amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot;, it was &amp;quot;Watcha doo-ing?&amp;quot; kinda thing. I explained to him how timelapse works, and he seemed to catch on fairly quickly. A few minutes later he and his friend had jumped into their van and gone speeding off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly at Piccadilly Circus, a few young Germans came up to me and complemented me on my gear - it was the 600D with 20-40mm, a VideoMic and an LCDVF, all on a tripod. They themselves both had 5D mkIIs and I was slightly miffed. They already knew what timelapse was. I should keep business cards on me more often for this kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While standing in the cold/rain/wind(/sun?!), the only thing I could really do was play with my phone, and to that effect I did what I like doing most with my phone - taking photos. Here&amp;#39;s a slideshow of all the photos I took while standing around. My favourite is a photo of a Star Wars battle that unfolded next to me during the first shot of Piccadilly Circus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[fsg_gallery id=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and after all of that, I guess you want to watch the end product. Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting fact before you watch: the first shot was actually a mistake - I had Gorillapodded my very back-heavy DSLR to a railing that was very close to some glass (hence the crap on the lens in those shots in Earl&amp;#39;s Court), and started the timelapse, only to realize a minute later that my camera was pointed at the ceiling. This resulted in a rather interesting (and slow) camera move that I thought started the video well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll shut up now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one last thing. If you&amp;#39;re wondering what the hell was happening in Trafalgar Square, it was a live re-enactment of the crucifixion, because it was Good Friday, or something. And that&amp;#39;s a CCTV camera you can see spinning in the top left hand corner. And the London Eye spun backwards for a bit, nothing wrong with _my _footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/41702388 &quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/41702388&quot;&gt;Transport for London&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/alexforey&quot;&gt;Alex Forey&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one last thing. There is a reason there&amp;#39;s a wait before the video begins. Two, actually. First being that players like Vimeo and YouTube generally have some sort of overlay, I want the user to be able to have already gotten rid of it before the content starts, and secondly that I want you to be really focused on the screen &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the video starts, because it helps you pick up the sense of rhythm faster (I think).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Fortrus</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have started another thing. Whoops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time, it&amp;#39;s a tech blog; and I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say it&amp;#39;s fairly awesome. It&amp;#39;s not just me however, because otherwise there wouldn&amp;#39;t be much point of a blog other than this one. In fact, as far as I know, there&amp;#39;s Henry Dyer, Amos Jackson, Robert Young, Nicolas Weninger, Albert Meek and Hugo Cheema-Grubb. I really can&amp;#39;t be bothered to link to all their pages. It will take a long time, and it will get boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I have to explain why I named it what I did. Oh, except you still don&amp;#39;t know. Well in that case it&amp;#39;s called &amp;quot;The Fortrus&amp;quot;, and it has the most epic badass domain name out there - &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortr.us&quot;&gt;http://fortr.us&lt;/a&gt;. And that&amp;#39;s not the short name either. And it was called the Fortrus because of the links to a pre-existing group at school self-named &amp;quot;The Fortress of Solitude&amp;quot;, after that place in one of Marvel&amp;#39;s comics. And to fit that in with an inexpensive yet also awesome domain name, I deliberately misspelt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And isn&amp;#39;t that interesting. It also has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/thefortrus&quot;&gt;Twitter &lt;/a&gt;and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.com/fortrus&quot;&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt; (shudder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now some stuff for geeks. You may be wondering a) how I got my own hosted short URLs, that you can find in the Twitter feed; and b) how I got it to tweet automatically through my own app on Twitter. Well, two simple plugins for WordPress.org (which I&amp;#39;m &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; using as the engine for this blog) can do the job for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is &amp;quot;la petite url&amp;quot;, which is the one that allows you to have your own short URLs. That&amp;#39;s cool, and requires virtually zero-configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is &amp;quot;TweetUpdater&amp;quot;, which nicely enough has integration the &amp;quot;la petite url&amp;quot; built right in. The only difference is that you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.twitter.com/apps&quot;&gt;make your own Twitter app&lt;/a&gt;, go into the plugin editor in WordPress and replace the current tokens with the one from your app. Now whenever your WordPress bot Tweets, in the info you can see it was &amp;quot;via The Fortrus&amp;quot;. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing - I&amp;#39;m using the BackWPup to back up my entire installation of WordPress both on this blog and at the Fortrus, so that you can effectively nuke my servers and I&amp;#39;ll still have  an instantly replaceable blog. The cool thing about BackWPup is that it can back up to many different places simultaneously, and so I&amp;#39;ve set it to save to Dropbox and email. And so to kill either this blog or the Fortrus, you&amp;#39;d have to blow up my servers, Dropbox&amp;#39;s servers, Google&amp;#39;s server&amp;#39;s and my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck trying.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>I have a bad feeling</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have to say - I have a bad feeling like this. Today, Facebook announced they are going to buy Instagram, my favourite app, for a sum total of $1,000,000,000 dollars (note my use of the American billion there), in a combination of cash and stock in Facebook itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, this makes me worried. Why? Because I dislike Facebook and their lack of transparent privacy policies, and frankly how much they already know about me. I&amp;#39;ll go into this deeper if you want (well, actually I don&amp;#39;t care what you want, I&amp;#39;ll tell you anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly my problem is my friends. I have around 250, and I only trust about 10 of them who know what they&amp;#39;re doing in terms of Privacy. The sheer volume of data that Facebook has almost certainly built up about me over the course of around two years must be immense. Facebook even knows my email addresses that I haven&amp;#39;t personally shared with them, because one of my friends who has that new email in their address book let Facebook trawl through it in the vague hope that that user would find more of their friends to add on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one more thing unnerves me: the volume of crap apps on Facebook. I have no idea what those apps are doing with my data. Most of the small personally developed ones almost certainly do not follow the API terms and conditions involving Privacy. For instance, you may recall that famous app from a few days ago named &amp;quot;Girls Around Me&amp;quot;? And how it was only banned as an app on Facebook 3 days after it was featured on the front page of major tech websites, such as Cult of Mac, Gizmodo and Mashable? Interesting. Now think of how many apps haven&amp;#39;t been noticed yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s the option for apps to &amp;quot;access the details of your friends, even when you&amp;#39;re not online&amp;quot;, or something similar. More people I don&amp;#39;t know gaining access to my private information. Again, this comes round to trusting my friends. And I can tell you now that I only trust 1/25 of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so now I&amp;#39;ve explained why I don&amp;#39;t like Facebook, I will explain why I&amp;#39;m anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Spotify? That cool music app that you used to know and love? Well. Then it was bought by Facebook. And then Facebook introduced a sign in with Facebook option. And the Facebook forced you to sign in with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you can&amp;#39;t get Spotify without Facebook. No Facebook account? No Spotify account. This in some ways is receding into what I remember happened when I started using the web, around 8-ish years ago (I&amp;#39;m only 14, remember). There would be this cool free thing, but to get it you&amp;#39;d have to sign up for a whole lot of other stuff that you almost certainly didn&amp;#39;t want. And that was in 2004. And now we&amp;#39;re in 2012. And look how far the web has come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, did I mention that when sending music to someone in Spotify, you have three options. Firstly, send through Spotify (seems normal); secondly, send though Facebook (wouldn&amp;#39;t do it, but yeah fine); and finally send through WinLive Messenger or some crap like that. But this is not what you think. Sending through Windows Live functions exactly as you&amp;#39;d expect it to. But that&amp;#39;s where the morals stop. Both sending through Facebook and sending through Spotify opens a Facebook message to the person in question, with the song attached. Not good. (This phenomenon was first noted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.michaelhenley.co.uk/2012/02/04/spotify-integration/&quot;&gt;Michael Henley&lt;/a&gt;, as far as I can recall).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I&amp;#39;m worried the same thing will happen to Instagram. First, Facebook will creep in with the slightly-more-than-just-integration, and then they&amp;#39;ll just go full out with the sign in with Facebook only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like the level of Integration with Facebook already - in that when &amp;quot;sharing&amp;quot; to Facebook from Instagram you don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;share&amp;quot;, you just upload another copy to Facebook, and under their own terms and conditions, they now own that photo. Does that mean in the future, Facebook will own every single photo ever taken with Instagram? I hope not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what could Facebook do to not screw things up? Well, there&amp;#39;s quite a lot, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, and foremostly, don&amp;#39;t require Facebook logins. Do what Amazon did when they bought IMDB in 1999 or what they did when they bought Audible - add them as part of your company, but keep them separate entities. Amazon gives you the option to keep your IMDB and Amazon accounts completely separate, totally unlinked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; Facebook users will link their accounts with Instagram, but &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;#39;t make it compulsory. Because there will be a few, like me, who really don&amp;#39;t want Facebook knowing any more about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing they could do is keep the teams completely separate and different. Hell, put them in different cities! Just don&amp;#39;t overly influence an app that is already pretty much perfect. Why? Because Instagram focused on one thing and one thing only - awesome photo-taking and photo-sharing capabilities. If they try to do more, they&amp;#39;ll certainly, without doubt, make the app, and ecosystem, worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another thing: don&amp;#39;t allow desktop uploads. Instagram was always meant to be mobile, and just &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; the amount of crap that would be taken with laptop webcams for &amp;quot;artsy&amp;quot; profile pictures. There is a reason there&amp;#39;s no API method for uploading photos that might have been taken anywhere, on anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe I&amp;#39;m being too harsh. After all, being bought by Facebook my be the best thing that&amp;#39;s ever happened to Instagram. A thirteen person team&amp;#39;s fun, but do you really think an Android app would have taken this long if Facebook had already bought them? And what about that iPad app? Granted, you may look ridiculous holding a massive iPad up in front of your face to take a photo, but surely Instagram should provide a platform for people to make idiots out of themselves if they want to? With Facebook, this may be coming a lot sooner than previously thought (although, giving Facebook reputation with iPad apps I may be wrong...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I hope that Instagram can be to Facebook what YouTube was to Google - integrated, yet separate, and thriving in being part of a giant multi-national company who could support it both technically and financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am overall not too optimistic about the future of Instagram after today. Prove me wrong, Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>K'NEX Roller Coaster</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Just recently I returned to an old hobby of mine: building moving structures out of K&amp;#39;NEX, after realising how much they could be enhanced by a little knowledge of programming and the use of a microcontroller (in my case my Arduino Uno).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I used to do this on a regular basis, but somehow stopped because of exams and school becoming &amp;quot;more important&amp;quot;, blah blah blah. But recently I moved up to a &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; school (as those of you who are Americans would call it), and in the first year the focus is more on finding out what you like to do and doing more of it, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, over the course of around 8 hours I build this awesome &amp;#39;coaster. It&amp;#39;s made from random assorted parts from an old ball machine from 2004 and a more recent roller coaster pack (the one that uses micro-k&amp;#39;nex, not the old variety), as well as some other ones that I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly - perhaps some of a ferris wheel in there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once I had build this, I made some basic traffic lights out of a breadboard and some LEDs, and made a gate to prevent cars from moving onto the chain lift before the other had gotten off, by taping some red rods to a servo. I then programmed this in a basic loop. Here&amp;#39;s some pseudo code that follow along the lines of :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;setup {
    Start servo assign LED pins, etc..
    State open and closed angles for servo
    Set the servo to be closed
}

loop {
    Do the open the gate routine
    Wait a while
}

Gate routine {
    Turn on the traffic lights in order
    Open the servo, then close it quickly (only one roller on the car goes through)
    Wait not very much
    Open the servo again
    Turn off the traffic lights.    
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time I bought a Jessops flashgun (for a much discounted price, which I&amp;#39;m very pleased about), and I was experimenting with the whole idea of external flash, getting the exposure right, angles, shadows, etc. I even (at one point) used three flashes for the same shot at different times: the onboard one triggered by the camera, my old 300EZ triggering my new Jessops one via a master/slave protocol. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexforey/sets/72157629703199571/&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a Flickr Gallery of the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, as I usually do, I decided to make a video about it. I used my 600D, 50mm f/1.4 and some &amp;quot;arty&amp;quot; music. Some people have described it as &amp;quot;veh GCSE art.&amp;quot; And so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/39497272 &quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now on to my next project. But you&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see what it is (although that might take a while, as it involves heavy uses of other people&amp;#39;s APIs, most of which use oAuth. And I hate oAuth.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See ya later bye.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>United 93 Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/united-93.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A brief note to the readers of this post who aren&amp;#39;t my English teacher: We watched United 93 over the course of three English lessons, with a substantial gap in between. This might affect my overall view of the film in some way, but I&amp;#39;ll try to minimise that. When we finished watching it, my English teacher asked me to write a review on it, and so here it is.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to write this as a blog post for two main reasons: the first being it was set as a homework so I have to do it, but second realised that when I started this blog it was intended to mainly film reviews. I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure why I haven&amp;#39;t posted many reviews, although my guess is that I usually see films at the cinema at the weekend, and so by the time I&amp;#39;ve got round to writing them school starts again for a whole week and I don&amp;#39;t get the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on to the real review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United 93 is a film about 9/11, from the perspective of the people on the ground in Air Traffic Control, and the citizens on board United Airlines flight 93. In retrospect you could refer to it as &amp;quot;the only one of the four that didn&amp;#39;t hit its target&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with that statement is that it contradicts the perspective of the film entirely. United 93 is effectively a &amp;quot;fictional documentary&amp;quot; shot later with the blank wholes filled in; meaning that it was shot several years after the event itself, based off real events, with informed fiction to take the place of unknown events during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the events unfold in real-time, from the perspective of the people involved. This makes for a much more involved, tense, and absorbing film. The fact that it is likely that you probably already know how the film ends is made irrelevent by how well this is done. In terms of shooting style (the filmmaker in me coming out here), it was entirely hand-held, with no use of tripods or even steadicams. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010096/&quot;&gt;Barry Ackroyd&lt;/a&gt; also used a relatively slow shutter speed, one of about 1/50 (obeying the 180 degree shutter rule), to enhance the motion blur effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339030/&quot;&gt;Paul Greengrass&lt;/a&gt; also completely ignores rules like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180_degree_rule&quot;&gt;180 Degree Rule&lt;/a&gt;, again enforcing the idea that this is not a traditional film, but more of a first-person account from all the locations. This is further backed up by way some actors deliberatley walk between the camera and the subject, as if the camera was a person, jostling to get a good view of the radar screens or similar. What does detract from this slightly is the standard following of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds&quot;&gt;Rule of Thirds&lt;/a&gt;, as the human eye tends to stay fairly still in situations like this, with the head moving to focus on the desired object, hence creating fairly centered framing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes of this film center mainly around organised chaos, and the way that a few small people can effect the world in such a massive way. There was a total of 19 terrorists participating in the attacks, and togther they killed over 3000 people, injured over 6000, and directly effected 36,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaos was one of the terrorists&amp;#39; main weapons. They managed to remotely envoke fear and disorder at all the main Air Traffic Control rooms on the east coast, as well as the military and civil services. Nobody knew for certain which planes had been hijacked.And this in turn lead to another problem for the people on the ground - oversuspicion. Air Traffic Control in New York had a list of around 40, contianing only 3 of the 4 hijacked planes (the other one was United 93, that was only reported as a hijack 4 minutes after it had crashed). They could not take the much-needed action on the few planes that were in fact hijacked, because they had been over-suspicious, and so they were checking too many red herrings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second idea that a small few can affect the lives of so many is a theme present in much of moden life - for instance in 1997 Steve Jobs said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different#Text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the terrorists&amp;#39; different was not a good different (from the perspective of the western world) - it was &amp;quot;immoral&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;disruptive&amp;quot; and sometimes &amp;quot;downright evil&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two proposed endings for the film; differing by only the text shown after the crash of the plane. In one of them the words were &amp;quot;America&amp;#39;s War on Terror had begun&amp;quot; and the other was &amp;quot;Dedicated to all those who lost their lives on September 11, 2011&amp;quot;. I strongly feel that the second is the most appropriate, as the film would not have been possible without the real events that unfolded on that day, and to that effect there should be an enormous amount of sensitivity regarding the real people that participated in those events. The first is also unappropiate because it suggests that events as bad as this would happen repeatedly and therefore would provide more material to make more films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end they second ending was used, and I&amp;#39;m glad they did. There are not many things I would change about this film, possibly the only thing would be the framing in some of the shots, but that is very minor, and could be viewed as unimportant due to the style of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all I thought this was an incredibly affecting film, realistic and powerful. I would heavily recommend it to anyone who appreciates this genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you later bye.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Shwiing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shwiing.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello. This is my latest venture. I have named it Shwiing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you&amp;#39;re probably like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/kf0yQbrY9Pw?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, I&amp;#39;ll start at the beginning. I recently got into the whole Internet of Things and Arduino scene, decided that I would like the two to be one. So I started looking around for an easy way to collect standard data online, but found none. I assumed this was because everyone just set up their own server and database to deal with these things. So I set about doing the same for myself. But then I was like: hang on a minute. Being the web developer that I am, I just couldn&amp;#39;t help turning this into a service for others, who are perhaps not as capable in the online world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I decided to challenge myself - I had never got the Twitter API working successfully - I&amp;#39;d always get an error saying I wasn&amp;#39;t authorized or something. So I decided to make the whole registration process based off Twitter. This was also a good idea, because what if I wanted to be able to tweet every time my device collected some information? Well that was easily solved because I get to store people&amp;#39;s access tokens for Twitter when they sign up, so I can (if the user asks for it) open up a new instance of the Twitter API, tweet, then close it all on one script of PHP, without callbacks or anything, because we&amp;#39;ve already been authorized. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then came to the name. To be honest this is the only one of my ventures where the name came to me straight away. This was because there is no nice way to say &amp;quot;A service that collects data from the real world, tweets about it, and stores it in a database&amp;quot; shortly, without saying &amp;quot;ASTCDFTRWTAIASIIAD&amp;quot;. Snappy. So I decided to come up with something completely unrelated - an amusing sound. Nobody ever questioned Spotify&amp;#39;s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just calculated that there&amp;#39;s 1440 lines of code in total throughout the site, including my functions, but excluding the external libraries that I used, like twitteroauth and jpGraph (which by itself has over 5620 lines, not all of which are used in this project); although only around 100 are visible in the source code of any one page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fairly hefty project - but I completed the preliminary stages (Twitter integration, user system, collecting data, tokens etc...) in around 5-6 hours of solid coding, while I was recovering from an illness. I added features like the whole Graph system yesterday in around 2 hours of experimentation, and reading the copious documentation that came with jpGraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a full explanation of how to use the site, and what it specifically does, you can read my guide, which took by itself around an hour to write, with updates as I added new features &lt;a href=&quot;http://shwiing.co/guide&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on a small sample project that is basically an internet-connected thermometer running an LM35DZ connected to an Arduino Uno R3 with an LCD attached, which then sends serial to a computer running Processing, that will update the temperature on Shwiing, which then draws a graph over time. All very nice isn&amp;#39;t it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature which I haven&amp;#39;t yet fully documented in the Guide is my API for reading data from a device. It&amp;#39;s all very well sending data to a server, but what&amp;#39;s more interesting is when you can have real objects reacting to other real objects that it has no physical connection with. And to that effect, provided you know your device&amp;#39;s token, you can return a JSON array of either the device&amp;#39;s information at http://shwiing.co/api/info?t=YOURTOKEN or the data that your device has collected over time at http://shwiing.co/data?t=YOURTOKEN. So this is all very fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future I might add more functionality along these lines, so people do not have to write their own PHP scripts that, for instance, can display your device&amp;#39;s most recent piece of data, which can then be downloaded onto another Arduino for use elsewhere, but for now they&amp;#39;ll have to settle for the example that I&amp;#39;m about to write in the guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this post was comprehensive enough, and if not feel free to ask me anything in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Actually it would be quite nice to have a real comment - after &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmandstuff.co.uk/405-great-move-mkii&quot;&gt;The Great Move MkII&lt;/a&gt; I forgot to turn on Akismet again, so over the past few days I&amp;#39;ve had spam comments pouring in along the lines of &amp;quot;Actually genuinely great weblog article which has received me considering. I by no means looked at this from the stage of look at.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Nice piece of info that you’ve got in submit. Hope can get some a lot more of this stuff on your website. I’ll are available back.&amp;quot;. Thank God I remembered that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next time - BAI&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Remix</title>
				<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;remix (&lt;strong&gt;v&lt;/strong&gt;) - Produce a different version of (a musical recording) by altering the balance of the separate tracks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another post today, this one technically for scholarly purposes, but I thought you might be interested as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A  remix could be said to be (re)creativity. The idea of taking someone else&amp;#39;s work, altering and manipulating it heavily, then producing it as your own. It has caused a lot of controversy in recent years, with the advent of digital media. (When I say recent, I don&amp;#39;t mean two years, I mean 20 years or so. Unknown to most teenagers today, there was actually a world more than 20 years ago...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is a remix. There is hardly &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; an idea that has not been influenced in some way by the ideas that have come before it, from other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biological evolution is a process of remix. Old species were taken, copied and changed to form the new species. The best of those remixes survived, the others died out. But this is not just the case with biological evolution. It&amp;#39;s also the case with &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; evolution. The culture and ideas that make our world what it is today are based off the whole idea of &lt;em&gt;memes&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m not talking about internet memes (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/007/447/hello-yes-this-is-dog.png&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), but &lt;em&gt;real world&lt;/em&gt; (yes that still exists) memes. These are things like ideas, skills, and just general behaviour. In this case, the internet does come heavily into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t seen this already, you really should. It&amp;#39;s a web series by Kirby Ferguson entitled &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Everything is a Remix&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, in four parts. Here&amp;#39;s the first for you to watch, the rest you&amp;#39;ll have to click &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/FP0i1D&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/14912890 &quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/14912890&quot;&gt;Everything is a Remix Part 1&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/kirbyferguson&quot;&gt;Kirby Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real world can be affected by the internet, you know. Ever heard people randomly say &amp;quot;LOL&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;then I took an arrow to the knee&amp;quot; in school, or worse, &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;? This is a meme: a behaviour that has copied and modified because it has been deemed &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. The same is true for ideas: one person at school starts web development, loads of people  follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#39;d just mention that that one person was actually &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, and that one lunch break I saw someone copying heavy chunks of the source code from &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexforey.com&quot;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt; and trying to understand it. I&amp;#39;m not against someone trying to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; my hard work, but what I don&amp;#39;t like is when people take snippets from my code, and just &lt;em&gt;copy&lt;/em&gt; them into their own design, without modifying it, crediting me, or even fully understanding it. That is not a remix, that is &lt;em&gt;theft&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;#39;m in favour of the remix (the common term) is that, in my view, some of the best creativity is through a process of remix. And more often than not, the product is free. Let&amp;#39;s take the evolution of one song from my dubstep collection: _Midnight City _by M83.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts off as a regular music track. It sounds like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F19087066&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it gets used in TV Shows and professional media, like &amp;quot;Made in Chelsea&amp;quot; on E4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it gets remixed. Many times. In fact, M83 themselves uploaded the remixes to their own SoundCloud account. This is a good thing, as it demonstrates artists acknowledging other people&amp;#39;s work as party theirs and partly their own. Here&amp;#39;s my favourite remix - by PatrickRezza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26022693&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is offered as a free download on his Facebook page, and on dubstep.net.  This is taken and then set to an amazing YouTube video, made in Seattle to promote the local stadium:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/98EvwIGFB7s?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for once, nobody prosecuted anybody, and everything was fine. But that is not always the case. This is because our current system of law thinks of ideas as individual bubbles, owned by someone or something. This is known as intellectual property. And this, in itself was a meme. And it spread heavily, due to a human psychological phenomenon known as &amp;quot;Loss Aversion&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the idea people put a much higher value on losses than on gains. Therefore, when we steal from someone else, it&amp;#39;s OK. We justify it with something along the lines of &amp;quot;it won&amp;#39;t make any difference to that massive company with its fat cat executives if I pirate one of their movies , just once.&amp;quot; On the other hand, if you worked for &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; on that animation, sweating over making sure the plasticine models didn&amp;#39;t fall over, we get angry. And understandably - &amp;quot;why should someone be allowed to steal from me, if I&amp;#39;ve done the hard work?!?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is summarised well in Part 4 of that documentary I mentioned earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Most of us have no problem with copying (as long as we&amp;#39;re the ones doing it)&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;ve got where we are today - that meme spread throughout the entire world, and so the law reacted by preventing the later, at the expense of the former. In this &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;new age&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, however, people don&amp;#39;t like it very much any more. These laws, along with YouTube&amp;#39;s auto-copyright-detection-thing-bot-o-matic, mean that it&amp;#39;s now very hard for people to share remixes they have created from content originally created by large companies. I leave you with this, another chain in social evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/y2fl-sHUwrc?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/sfkDxF2kn1I?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/kBO5dh9qrIQ?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Great Move MkII</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, we&amp;#39;re moving again. Oh, and I&amp;#39;m also going to re-design this again. I will outline the how and the why of both those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the move. This blog started off humbly, hosted by the great WordPress itself. Then I got sick of having to have a .wordpress.com name, and the limited preferences. So, I moved over to the &amp;quot;amazing&amp;quot; x10Hosting.com. It worked well for the first few months, but then things started to go downhill. I figured out that over the last week we&amp;#39;ve had around 25-35% downtime, which is unacceptable for somebody like me. It wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily the HTTP server, it was the database server as well. So sometimes you&amp;#39;d get a &amp;quot;Error establishing database connection&amp;quot; message, generated by WordPress as it frantically tried to find everything it needed to run, and sometimes it just didn&amp;#39;t work at all. So that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m moving again. But it&amp;#39;s not just this blog, it&amp;#39;s gonna be my entire web empire (which, by the way, is quite expansive, but you already know that...). That includes this, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexforey.com&quot;&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://duckhouseproductions.co.uk&quot;&gt;Duck House Productions&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://pickture.me&quot;&gt;Pickture&lt;/a&gt;, and my upcoming amazing project Shwiing. You&amp;#39;ll see what that is later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of where I&amp;#39;m moving to, I&amp;#39;ve chosen to go with &lt;a href=&quot;http://krystal.co.uk&quot;&gt;Krystal&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because I&amp;#39;m from the UK and it was recommended to me by &lt;a href=&quot;http://preoccupations.org&quot;&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who found me a promo code that got me 50% of... :-D. I&amp;#39;ve gone with the Topaz option, which should cover all my hosting needs for the next three years. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in terms of the re-design - it&amp;#39;s not that I don&amp;#39;t like this theme, it&amp;#39;s just that it&amp;#39;s mote than a theme. This is PageLines. These guys basically want to make money for themselves using WordPress, a free, open-source CMS, and I don&amp;#39;t really like that. They&amp;#39;re trying to be a CMS inside a CMS, which is not on for me. There is a settings page, inside my settings page. Not on for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m going to be swapping over for a completely clean installation of WordPress with a new (heavily modified) theme, which I&amp;#39;m currently in the process of choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;#39;m going to migrate all the posts to the new blog, so don&amp;#39;t worry about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and expect some downtime for the next few days, on all my websites, as I frantically move everything from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you on the other side, Alex&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Re-Design</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody. Welcome to the new Film and Stuff. I&amp;#39;ve redesigned this blog to make it look more fresh, and focus more on the content - less background images, less jQuery animation, less frills. This time it&amp;#39;s all about what I&amp;#39;ve got to say, which is the main bit of a blog, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have focused a lot on the typography, and have decided to go with Georgia for three reasons. Firstly, it&amp;#39;s kinda classic, looks nice and it easy to read. Secondly, it&amp;#39;s already installed on pretty much every computer throughout the entire universe (save perhaps Linux machines, although I&amp;#39;m sure they have some kind of similar font), therefore I don&amp;#39;t need to go about importing fonts in CSS3 via @font-face, meaning slower page loads and more complicated code. Keeping it simple. Thirdly, it comes with a ridiculous amount of different options for weights styles and stuff. Therefore, I&amp;#39;ve also adjusted the kerning, and decided to use small-caps for the titles. I think it looks better. Much funner. (Just putting that in there to annoy any English teachers that may be present in the room...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, I use WordPress(.org) on (at the moment) free servers outside WordPress themselves. Main reasons for that is that you get to use plug-ins, your own domain name without paying, and lots more control over the file structures behind filmandstuff.co.uk itself. Hence I can upload things if I want, to live in their own folders, and to be available to me at any time I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this upgrade of theme comes, PageLines. I&amp;#39;m not quite actually sure what the hell this is - from my perspective it&amp;#39;s someone trying to make their own CMS inside another CMS (WordPress to be exact). Why? I have no idea. I just quite like the way they give you the option for advanced font styling without having to get your hands dirty with the CSS. Oh, and I quite like the look of the theme itself. Oh, and it&amp;#39;s nice and responsive, so it plays nicely with phones as well as 27&amp;quot; iMacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one problem though, in the previous theme I was using &lt;a href=&quot;http://fitvidsjs.com&quot;&gt;FitVids.js&lt;/a&gt; (a jQuery Plugin) to scale  YouTube and Vimeo videos that I had embedded in posts so the kept their aspect ratio while scaling to the width of the post container. When I changed theme, this broke. I have still got the FitVids.js and jQuery.js included on this page (as you can see in the &amp;quot;Inspect Element&amp;quot; thing in new browsers if you could be bothered), but it&amp;#39;s not playing nicely with the new theme. When I have more time I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll get it fixed, though.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mountain Lion</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mountain-lion.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. OK. Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Not that much) earlier today, Apple kinda unofficially announced Mac OS X Mountain Lion, although nowadays they seem to have dropped the &amp;quot;Mac&amp;quot; bit, assuming that everyone already knows what it is, and so they now refer to is as simply &amp;quot;OS X&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to bother going through all the new features, because you could just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/&quot;&gt;hop over to Apple&amp;#39;s official page&lt;/a&gt; which details them much better then I ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I did notice that there is a link to that page on the Apple US Homepage (apple.com), but there is not one on the Apple UK page (apple.com/uk). I&amp;#39;m not quite sure why not, maybe they&amp;#39;re busy translating their US page into proper English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on with the show. Basically, Apple are taking all are most loved features from iOS (notification centre, iMessage, Reminders, Notes, and Game Center - notice spelled the wrong way), and putting them into OS X. Not a bad move, unlike what &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmandstuff.co.uk/204-windows8&quot;&gt;Microsoft did&lt;/a&gt;, which was the other way round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is big in it&amp;#39;s own way, and I&amp;#39;ll be interested to see how well it works. The advance of iMessage is just another step in the direction of blowing BBM and RIM out of the water completely. Which I think is a good thing, for reasons I may outline in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all very well and good, but there is something more which interested me. Finally, it appears that Apple have started to properly integrate iCloud into the heart of OS X. This might well &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/7Y7hRZ4c&quot;&gt;blow Dropbox out of the water&lt;/a&gt; as well. Well, isn&amp;#39;t Apple doing well for themselves with this update? There are going to be two completely different &amp;quot;Finders&amp;quot;, one &amp;quot;On my Mac&amp;quot; and one &amp;quot;iCloud&amp;quot;, although again this is all still speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am generally staggered by the speed that Apple can produce these operating systems, and as they outline in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/features.html#video-mountainlion&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, it will be less than a year between the release of Lion and Mountain Lion. Microsoft could not even compete with this speed, and the predicted release date for Windows 8 means it will have been three years between Windows 8 and Windows 7, and as I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmandstuff.co.uk/204-windows8&quot;&gt;my Windows 8 review&lt;/a&gt;, there actually doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be much difference at all between the two. So what have Microsoft been doing for three years? Designing the new start screen, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you soon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why Google Plus is called Google Plus</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post - I have a meatier one coming soon, but I&amp;#39;m preparing for a film shoot tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a recent ICT lesson about how Google intend to move towards completely personalized searches, a new way that Google intends to use your data was mentioned: Google Plus will boost results on search pages based on what people in your Google Plus circles have recently viewed. This comes with a lot of other changes Google have made regarding privacy and use of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that got me thinking - what&amp;#39;s in the name &amp;quot;Plus&amp;quot;. It doesn&amp;#39;t suggest a social network (although to be fair, most of the names of &lt;em&gt;popular&lt;/em&gt; social networks don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; suggest that either). It suggests an extension of Google, a better Google. Maybe that&amp;#39;s what Google Plus was always meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Google&amp;#39;s being particularly crafty - their previous &amp;quot;social networks&amp;quot; failed because they were trying to compete with the likes of Facebook, which (currently) has around 850 million users. No chance. But this time it is different - Google are trying to offer this as a way of enjoying stuff with your friends, AND enhance your everyday search experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm... clever. Google Plus being an extension of the Google search engine, rather than just another failed social network. Good thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what people used to think of Google as being - their eyes set on sights that were fundamentally beyond what the company was created to do. But think of this scenario - my friend showed me this link a while ago. He can&amp;#39;t remember it, I can&amp;#39;t remember it. He remembered that he searched for it, though. So that&amp;#39;s OK. So all I have to do is make sure that I communicate with him fairly frequently on Google Plus. That way I can use more vague search terms (or less precise, depending on what floats your boat), and still find what I&amp;#39;m looking for. This is a good idea, as long as you trust an internet Giant like Google with your &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2012/02/google-paying-users-to-track-100-of-their-web-usage-via-little-black-box.ars&quot;&gt;browser history&lt;/a&gt;. Which I don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about that. Just a little theory of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex, signing off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS - I&amp;#39;m particularly annoyed about Google at the moment, aren&amp;#39;t I?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Oh dear, AdSense.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I suppose it&amp;#39;s about time for another blog post. This time I hope to give you a brief outline of my experience with Google Adsense. Which, by the way, is not a good one (as you can probably tell from the title).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will start at the beginning. I generally find this is a good idea. I make YouTube videos, as you know. One day, after making my tutorials about &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmandstuff.co.uk/57-muse&quot;&gt;Adobe Muse&lt;/a&gt;, I received an email from Google, asking if I wanted to make money from my videos by sharing some of the revenue of the ads that YouTube place next to your videos with me. I, of course, jumped at the prospect, being the entrepreneur that I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I go through all these menu screens about signing up for a Google AdSense account, with (an estimated) 10,000,000 words of Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies and Disclaimers. Why the capital letters? Why not. Eventually I reach a screen saying that the account that I&amp;#39;m about to create has to be in the name of someone over 18. Why? Legal reasons etc... but it does say that I can make it in the name of my parents and that&amp;#39;s all fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So eventually I start adding revenue sharing to all my YouTube videos, as well as some ads on my blog. You&amp;#39;ll see why they&amp;#39;ve gone later. I was earning between 3p and £2 a day. It was very erratic, but it was effectively free money for me. One thing I did note was that I would only be paid when my money hit multiples of £60 (or somewhere around $100 in the US). I thought that that would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a few weeks later, there was red writing all over my AdSense admin page. I was slightly worried, but after actually reading what they had to say, it figured out it was not so bad. The text said that I would not be sent any money &amp;quot;Until my address had been confirmed&amp;quot;. How were they going to do this? They would send me a physical piece of paper through the post with a code on it that I would then type back into the website to confirm I live in a real place. Which I did because I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of about 4 months, I racked up a grand total of about £70. I was thrilled - every little step closer to a MacBook Air, and my first payment would be arriving soon. But then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I log into Google AdSense to be greeted by a message saying that my account had been disabled for &amp;quot;Invalid Click Activity&amp;quot;. I was shocked. And wondering what on earth &amp;quot;Invalid Click Activity&amp;quot; could possibly mean. So I had a look at what their definition was, and basically it means that they think I&amp;#39;ve been telling people to click on my ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did they come to this conclusion? Well - I have a theory. As you can probably guess, I go to a school. I usually tell people about my blog from this thing called a &lt;em&gt;school&lt;/em&gt;. They usually visit my blog from this &lt;em&gt;school&lt;/em&gt;. And therefore, a fairly large amount of my ad clicks come from this &lt;em&gt;school&lt;/em&gt;. They see this as one fixed IP address making multiple ad clicks a day. It is therefore OK to for them to assume that I have some kind of spambot clicking on all my ads from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is I don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an &amp;quot;appeal&amp;quot; form, so I filled that in, outlining everything I have said above in under 400 characters. Why would you limit that? I have no idea. A couple of days later I received an email saying that &amp;quot;Google was sorry, but thought that re-instatement of my account would be impossible&amp;quot;. WHY?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rant Alert&lt;/em&gt; (I try not to use capslock, as I believe that &lt;a href=&quot;http://bukk.it/caps.jpg&quot;&gt;this is true&lt;/a&gt;, but in this case I have given an exception) Because SOMEONE AT GOOGLE IN IRELAND BECAUSE THEY CAN&amp;#39;T BE ARSED TO PAY FULL UK TAXES HAD NOT EVEN BOTHERED TO READ MY CLAIM FORM, WAS HAVING A BAD DAY OR GENERALLY WANTED TO PISS SOMEONE OFF. SO THEY DID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I am. I sent an angry email back in a fit of disgust. I assume they did not even read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So bottom line: this has happened to multiple friends of mine at the same school. One of them had it happen to them twice. I cannot imagine any of them are happy bunnies either. There have also been some friends who have decided suddenly that they want to make money out of their (epic fail) YouTube videos. I have tried to explain why I don&amp;#39;t think this is a good idea (or even very likely to happen) any more, and maybe this blog post will help explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now assume that just before every payment Google make to people they set an algorithm off to trawl through your click results to see if they find anything fishy. Upon doing so they terminate your account and don&amp;#39;t read your appeal form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very annoyed Alex, owed £70 by Google, singing off.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The End of Kodak</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was sad to hear that Kodak has recently gone bankrupt. I was sad for several reasons, but mainly as I see Kodak as being one of the main symbols of film (or &lt;em&gt;analogue&lt;/em&gt;) photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The other, by the way, is that whenever I go to Jessops to develop my film, they would give me a free Kodak film, so I would never actually have to buy any film at all; although I can imagine they&amp;#39;ll just swap over to another brand.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason that I think Kodak went under, is that they decided that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2012/01/20/kodak-digital-missteps/&quot;&gt;they did not want to dip into the digital world&lt;/a&gt;. I think this was a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Kodak made some of the first digital cameras, but they were only compact cameras. They never stepped up to the DSLR market, like Pentax did. Pentax make some of the highest megapixel DSLRs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why they decided that DSLRs were not the thing for them, but they also stopped making compact cameras. I am puzzled that they did not jump on the bandwagon of the new EVIL cameras, but I suppose it was because they decided that digital was not for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel this marks the end of an era, although to be honest I haven&amp;#39;t been around all that long. I love taking film photos, they have an aesthetic that can never be matched by digital straight out of the camera, but this is not a good reason for Kodak to refuse to do digital completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be interested to see if anybody can come up with any other reasons that Kodak refused to make digital cameras; if you do, drop a comment so other people can expand on this article.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>DIY DSLR Cage, Matte Box and Rail System for £25</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, peoples of teh internets. I have made an awesome (I say so myself) DIY DSLR Cage and 15mm Rail System. Now, if you&amp;#39;re a n00b at cameras, a brief explanation of what these things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DSLR cage serves two purposes, to enable mounting of multiple accessories, such as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photoxels.com/images/Sony/clm-v55/sony-clm-v55-b-800.jpg&quot;&gt;monitor&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soobumimphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/5A2O2022.jpg&quot;&gt;LED video light&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sSBAKgKLoUM/TDykoOTpyeI/AAAAAAAAEMA/xE_ZF37GqQI/s400/5D_MkII-Mic-BLOG-123.jpg&quot;&gt;microphone&lt;/a&gt;; and also to protect the DSLR if it were to fall off a tripod or be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rail system allows mounting of other types of accessories along the length of camera and lens, such as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://freytag-film.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Genus_mattebox.jpg&quot;&gt;matte box&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://loclum.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/focus-wheel.jpg&quot;&gt;follow focus&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philipbloom.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dslr20_models_0549_lg1.jpg&quot;&gt;shoulder mount&lt;/a&gt;. So the bottom line is, this allows me to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attach a whole lot of stuff to my camera without breaking it&amp;#39;s hot shoe or using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.warehouseexpress.com/webcontent/product_images/large/134/1010112.jpg&quot;&gt;ridiculous hot should extension&lt;/a&gt; arm thing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look more professional&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;looking more professional&amp;quot; is more important than you might think. It&amp;#39;s not just a case of ego-factor, but also the general public respects you more as a filmmaker doing a serious job when your gear looks extensive. You may have a whole tonne of skill, but the public can&amp;#39;t see that - you have to fully &amp;quot;display your colours&amp;quot; in order to make them respect you and therefore not try to intentionally ruin shots by walking by in a particularly inappropriate manner or looking straight into the camera lens etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now break it up into several sections: the cage, the matte box, and the rail system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cage was made entirely out of overpriced goods from B&amp;amp;Q (the feeble excuse for Home Depot in the UK). Parts list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4x 20cm length of Black 20mm Ø Black PVC Pipe (found on the end of the electric section)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4x 25cm length Square C-shaped aluminium bracket (found in the hardware section amongst all the other randomly arranged tall pieces of metal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4x 27cm length of 4mm threaded rod (doesn&amp;#39;t have to be 4mm, just a sturdy number between 3 and 6 to keep down the weight) (found next to the above item, although placing may vary depending on shop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x M4x25mm length bolts (or same as your threaded rod)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10x M4 (or the same as your threaded rod) nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random piece of wood or metal, measuring 9cm by 20cm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4x large diameter 25mm bolt, countersink head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4x nuts to fit those bolts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10cm of pine wood thing measuring around 2cm x 2.5cm (same as listed below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For rail mounts on cage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x 12cm of pine wood thing measuring around 2cm x 2.5cm (large enough to drill 16mm holes in without it splitting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4x M3 x 25mm bolts (exact)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x random scraps around 1cm x 4cm x 0.75cm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOOLS - these tools are not exact. You may be surprised by the amount of different sized drill bits mentioned here, but we (as a family) have a set of 100 useful bits and tools for a good price of around £30 - &lt;a href=&quot;http://image.auction.co.kr/itemimage/538/43/09/53843096.jpg&quot;&gt;http://image.auction.co.kr/itemimage/538/43/09/53843096.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4mm metal drill bit (same as threaded rod, etc.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6mm metal drill bit (same as beefy bolts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2mm wood drill bit (exact)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5mm wood drill bit (exact)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16mm wood drill bit (exact)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4mm plastic drill bit (same as threaded rod, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junior / Senior hack saw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pencil, ruler... etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wood glue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screwdriver of all sorts to fit bolts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AND A MASSIVE DRILL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuff you don&amp;#39;t need but I had so it made it easier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S7 Flat head screwdriver bit&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S4 Flat head screwdriver bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PH2 Philips head screwdriver bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7mm bolt head grip thing bit (Diameter of threaded rod + 3mm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black and Decker Workmate or some kind of proper vice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then arrange it so threaded rod goes through PVC to reinforce it, then through C-shaped metal on both sides followed by a nut on each end to secure it, like this (this photo is sideways)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/diy-cage-1.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, make two frames in a square shape, with PVC uprights and metal top and bottom. Then drill an M4 hole in the middle of the top metal bracket on both frames, cut another length of PVC pipe 20cm long, put holes in that and then bolt it to the top. Be careful with those bolts and nuts - you&amp;#39;ll use them when holding the camera by the handle - very important when having around £1000 of gear on it as well. It should now look like this (ignore the wood bit at the bottom for now)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/diy-cage-2.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, line up the piece of wood you cut and then cut holes in both the wood and the two metal horizontals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly there. One last thing and then we&amp;#39;ll get onto the rail mounts. Take another 10cm-ish of the pine wood and drill 3x 5mm holes in it in a line. These will act as tripod mounts for the cage. There are three so you can move to cage backwards or forwards on the tripod to counterbalance the weight of the camera, lens and matte box. Then wood glue that to the underside of the cage in a suitable position. This is why in the photo the cage appears to be hovering off the ground. Then take a tripod plate and carefully screw it into the three holes, so it creates it&amp;#39;s own thread inside the wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Building the Rail Mounts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are very important in this rig. Don&amp;#39;t mess them up. You&amp;#39;ll need to make 4 of these - two for the cage, one for the matte box and one for the camera. If you feel really creative you can make more for a DIY follow focus or something. That&amp;#39;s the point of a rail system - it&amp;#39;s expandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for each one  you need to do this. Take 12 cm of that pine wood. Take the bigger face and measure 3cm in for each end. Then drill one 16mm hole on each place you marked. This is where the rails go through. Then put the piece on it&amp;#39;s end and drill a 2mm hole straight down from the end until it breaks the wall of the 16mm hole. This will be where the bolts go in to stop the mount moving up and down the rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take two of the 3mm bolts and carefully screw them into the 2mm holes so they create their  own thread, much like the tripod mount in the previous section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have made 4 of these, take two of them and wood glue the two random scraps to the bottom of each one, then wood glue those to the cage in a suitable position, to allow access with a screwdriver to the bolts on each end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now take one more and drill a 5mm hole in the bottom of it. This will be the mount for the camera, and the hole is to allow mounting of the rails onto a tripod without the cage system, as seen in the earlier photo. Again, take a tripod plate and screw it into the hole to create a thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Rails Themselves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are basically just two 9&amp;quot; lengths of the 15mm dowel. That&amp;#39;s it. If you can find metal, do that, but I couldn&amp;#39;t so wood will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; The Matte Box&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather ingenious design, even if I do say so myself. It&amp;#39;s made out of an old VHS case, which means it folds flat when you don&amp;#39;t need it. First things first, rip off the plastic that covers both sides of it - we won&amp;#39;t be needing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then  find two random pieces of plastic (not metal - it&amp;#39;s too heavy), measuring about 15cm x the length of the short side of the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use much tape to secure them to each side of the open case and act as a hinge. Make sure it opens and closes without falling off. These act as the side flags. Then take some more tape (I prefer blue electrical tape - it looks more awesome) and Run it all the way around the edge of the case. This stops the lid from hinging in two places - only one in order to keep it less likely to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then cut a hole in the back of the case for the lens to look through. It&amp;#39;s going to be around 10mm in diameter larger then the filter size of your largest lens. I did this with a Stanley knife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, take your last mounting block and screw it to the bottom of your matte box to allow mounting on rails. For me it was already the perfect height for my DSLR, but you might need to add some more height between the mount and the matte box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Have Fun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was pretty much it. If I&amp;#39;ve forgotten to make anything clear, drop a comment. Have fun with your new kit, but remember - it&amp;#39;s not the gear that makes a movie, it&amp;#39;s creativity. Without a good story, good acting and a good idea, all this is useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex, signing off.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Christmas and Stuff</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d just like to say Merry Christmas to everybody excluding non-Christians to whom I say the awfully American &amp;quot;happy holidays&amp;quot;. And Happy New Year to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been perplexed by the whole GoDaddy scandal&amp;lt;!-- more --&amp;gt;
, to do with supporting SOPA and then not supporting SOPA. I don&amp;#39;t have time to tell you the whole story, and it has already been told by many people before, so I will simply provide you with a couple of links that you can look at with your eyeballs. Oh, and one last thing, I think what the Military Wives Choir are doing is excellent, and I hope that they become Christmas number 1 in the UK, and given their only competition is a donkey, I hope that should not be too difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway - links

				<title>Why I Hate Microsoft</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microsoft-sign.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is cool to like Apple, and it is cool to hate Microsoft. But in this fairly lengthy article I intend to demonstrate why I hate Microsoft and their products so very, very much. And not for the obvious reasons, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Brief Personal History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will start by giving you s brief history of the computers in my household over the last 10 years. It all started a long time ago, when I was only 7. We had one of these computers. It was super-awesome and we had a dial-up modem, although the only problem with that is I could not get on the internet without my parents noticing because of all the noise that it made when connecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was awesome. But then we went round to my cousin&amp;#39;s house over Christmas and they had (what looked like) the same computer as ours, but my cousin had this awesome game on it and that was &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; awesome (not that the word &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;was even around in those days). So eventually I bribed my parents to get it, and upon trying to install it, the computer crashed. Me, having practically no computer knowledge whatsoever, could not help. My Dad tried and tried but to no avail. Time to bring in IT support. They charged an extortionate rate then advised us to get a new computer. Our first computer lasted 2 years, and was only good for Excel Spreadsheets and Word 97. It had something like 128MB of RAM and a CRT display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the second computer. &lt;em&gt;Yay&lt;/em&gt;. It was some form of HP Pavillion or something and looked a bit like this, and was &lt;em&gt;shiny&lt;/em&gt;!!. That was thrilling. You could play DVDs on it and stuff. Well, not for long. About 1 year later, whenever you put in a DVD or something similar, it throw up a copyright error or something. Given that it was &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Media Center&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; PC, this was not good. On the upside, it had a relatively large HDD (128GB, which was amazing) and a &lt;em&gt;Flat Screen&lt;/em&gt;. This was also thrilling. It lasted for a while longer. I put too many programs on it, uninstalled them but little did I know that this did not remove the registry values and in the end I think that was the thing that killed it. Bear in mind that I was not as tech-savvy as I am now, and looking back I could have probably fixed quite a lot of things relatively easily. The end came when it got so slow that it took 7 minutes to load iTunes, and even then normally did not recognise my iPod. It could also barely run Word etc... so from the point of view of my Dad this was completely useless. We didn&amp;#39;t quite get rid of it yet, because in comes the Sony Vaio &lt;em&gt;Laptop&lt;/em&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;Laptop&lt;/em&gt; you say? Yes, a &lt;em&gt;laptop&lt;/em&gt;. That was OK and lasted for a while, but by today&amp;#39;s standards was fat and clunky and &lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then we got bored with waiting for iTunes to load for 10 minutes and stuff like that. So then we introduced Apple and their computers into our lives, in the form of a 2009 MacBook Pro, which by the way, is still going strong. It&amp;#39;s currently running Leopard, but sooner or later we&amp;#39;re going to update to Lion, or we might wait for OS X &amp;quot;Minx&amp;quot; or whatever the next one happens to be. This was awesome. I&amp;#39;d previously been to a few Apple stores and blown away by how easy and intuitive their computers, both desktop and laptop. Especially the iMac. Because there was no &amp;quot;box&amp;quot; to speak of - it was &amp;quot;in the screen&amp;quot;. And that got me thinking about how computers worked. How could you fit the same amount of stuff in the screen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. So after the HP Pavillion monstrosity died and burned, we got an iMac. It was the basic £999 one, but I loved it. This was the end of 2010. It made my life amazing. I had been using Google Docs for quite some time by then, and I no longer had to worry about compatibility issues. I could write something at home, pick it up at school and not have to worry about saving or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I got my laptop. I had a very difficult decision when choosing between Mac and Windows. You may think me apolitically stupid for choosing Windows over Mac when given the choice, but I will give you my reasoning. I wanted to do video editing. Why choose Windows? Because I could get a laptop that had a 2.8GHz Quad-Core Processor with 4GBs of RAM for £530. The equivalent MacBook Pro would cost £1600. And School was Windows based. So that was that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Recent Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had one of the worst possible experiences involving a computer in the last few days. I will say this. For Christmas, Apple is giving me 12 free things from the iTunes store, and one more thing for signing up to get the other free things. On the other hand, Microsoft gave me the present of claiming that my copy of Windows 7 was invalid and not genuine and therefore I had to re-install Windows. Basically my beautiful desktop background was turned black with an overlay of &amp;quot;This copy of Windows is not Genuine&amp;quot;. Oh and a f***ing annoying popup every five minutes that automatically launched &lt;em&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/em&gt; with the &amp;quot;Validate Windows Page&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may ask - why not just change the serial number to the one on the bottom of your laptop? Well I will tell you. Because my laptop was convinced that it was running Ultimate, not Home Premium, which is completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the end I had move all my 150GB of data to an external HDD which took 13 hours. That should be OK, methinks. But NO, I tell my laptop to copy four folders (Program Files, Program Files (x86), Users and wamp) to my external HDD, but it only copies half of each Program Files Folder and none of the actual contents of the Users folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then I shutdown my computer, took the plunge and completely format my internal HDD. Then I downloaded the Windows 7 Home Premium (x64) SP1 install DVD ISO on the iMac. Then I burnt that to a DVD-R using Disk Utility on the iMac because I didn&amp;#39;t trust my laptop to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after making sure that I wasn&amp;#39;t going to do anything that might involve masses of destruction to my important not-backed-up files, I shut down my laptop and went into the BIOS to configure settings so my laptop would boot off a DVD before booting off the hard drive. Then I had to hard-reset my laptop and boot off the DVD. Finally, after much waiting and worrying, a cursor appeared, then finally an installer wizard. (I_ hate &lt;em&gt;the word _wizard&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not even remotely magical.) So I went through it, formatting my hard drive etc... then I clicked on the button of &lt;em&gt;doom&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;Install&amp;quot;. Surprisingly enough it actually did install and stuff, but for some reason unknown to man it had to restart itself about eight times during the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this whole process I was posting multiple Twitter updates and Instagram Photos. Here they are. (Skip them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microsoft-1.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microsoft-2.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microsoft-3.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then finally it finished. I had do go out &lt;em&gt;into the real world&lt;/em&gt; for a while to buy Christmas presents so progress stalled for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did I know that the hardest part was still to come. And that problem is that of installing drivers. So when I got back from Westfield, I turned on my newly-reinstalled Laptop. Everything seemed to be going well. I put in a new password etc. and finally got to my new desktop. I thought - now to install a driver for the fingerprint reader, because I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that that won&amp;#39;t be included. I was right, but I was more right than I wanted to be. I discovered that Windows had not even detected the fact that I had a wireless LAN adapter installed in my laptop at all. It wasn&amp;#39;t in the list of network adapters, so I went into device manager and noticed that I wasn&amp;#39;t there either. I was &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; panicking by now. Then I noticed that there was a list of &amp;quot;Unrecognised Devices&amp;quot;. I thought well firstly, it&amp;#39;s not very out-of-the-ordinary. Why didn&amp;#39;t Windows pick it up? Even &lt;em&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/em&gt; picked up wireless when it was running off a &lt;em&gt;DVD&lt;/em&gt;. Well, because it&amp;#39;s Windows. And Windows is stupid like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Windows did detect my Ethernet interface, so I took my laptop down to the hall, where our (feeble excuse for a) router lives. I dug an Ethernet cable out of the basement (because I never use Ethernet... more about that in a future post), and plugged it straight in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did (oddly) was to go and find the driver for my fingerprint reader. Why I hear you (well I can&amp;#39;t actually hear you, but you know what I mean) cry. Surely you have more important things to be worried about? Well... meh. So I searched through a couple of HP forum posts and finally found the one I was looking for. Downloaded, Installed, Restarted, setup. OK. That was fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next problem - Wireless. But I thought hang on... there&amp;#39;s this annoying thing popping up and down so I clicked on it and low and behold - there were 73 updates waiting for me - one of which was a Broadcom Driver. That was hopefully what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microsoft-4.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there was one last thing to do to fix stuff - restart. So I restart and this happened....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microsoft-5.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namely, it automatically started up in Safe Mode and crashed when it finished loading the Windows files. So again I hard reset and it decides to work again, but starting in Normal Mode this time. And then another problem happened... this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microsoft-6.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the updates had been for my graphics card (which by the way had also been labelled as Generic, which it most certainly isn&amp;#39;t) and had convinced itself that my screen was 600px x 600px. Not a smart move. So again, I restarted the computer in the hope that it would fix itself. Which, luckily, it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND THEN, &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; I had to go about re-installing my programs. Of which there are many. But I had a thought - how many of those programs do I actually need? Well... about 50 out of the 264 previously installed. So I went about downloading them, and for future reference I made a list with the direct download links of my favourite programs on my website with my iPhone at this address - &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexforey.com/programs&quot;&gt;alexforey.com/programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final thing I did was to partition my hard-drive into two pieces - an OS partition (C:) and a data partition (D:), so that if this ever happened again I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about shipping 150GB of data around via USB2. Which is not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft vs Apple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go back to the idea of the Christmas presents given by Microsoft and Apple. One a 16.5 hour re-install, that would have petrified the average Joe and sent him running for a useless Microsoft tech support; the other some free stuff (that I will probably actually want) from their online store of music, movies, apps and TV shows. Which one would you prefer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, things were different. Around the time that we got our first computer, this was the general opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nowadays I feel that the general opinion has completely changed. This reflects more the origins of the two companies. Both Microsoft and Apple started out as &amp;quot;two guys in a garage&amp;quot;, but (as far as I can tell) Microsoft was always supposed to be a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; business, whereas Apple was just making computer for Steve Jobs&amp;#39; and Steve Wozniak&amp;#39;s friends. There&amp;#39;s another video coming up in a moment (which you really should have already seen), made by the BBC about Steve Jobs&amp;#39; life. And one thing that struck me was the fact that Bill Gates was working with Steve Jobs for a while, and just before the release of the Apple II (the first computer to use icons), he went off and released his own one a few weeks before the release of the Apple II. And I don&amp;#39;t think Steve Jobs ever forgave him for that (judging by his character I find this hardly surprising).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway - here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I think that this is it - I would never, &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; expect a new MacBook Pro, Air or iMac to have to re-install OS X because Apple disabled it. Apple seems to take the view (with practically all their software) that because you have it, you must have bought it. There is no serial number system on Snow Leopard or Lion, or Final Cut Pro X or Aperture. Apple trusts you. &lt;em&gt;Sure&lt;/em&gt;, there will be people who download it illegally, but Apple is willing to let them be. It doesn&amp;#39;t cost them anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, Microsoft validates &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; their products with online servers because they do not trust anyone. And people get round that system. It is said that somewhere between 35% - 45% of all copies of Windows are pirated by some means or another. On the other hand OS X has only got a rate of 5 - 15%. The reason? Apple goes out of their way to make it easy to buy their products. Most people pirate not because they can&amp;#39;t afford it, but because it&amp;#39;s actually easier than buying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To upgrade from Snow Leopard to Lion requires about five clicks - open Mac App Store, search for Lion, Install, Sign In, Confirm. That&amp;#39;s it. I&amp;#39;ve done it myself. But to upgrade from Vista to 7, you have to physically buy a disk (or a serial number), put it in your computer, launch the installer, click through about eight screens of copyright crap, put in your serial number which is like 32 characters long and then wait about eight hours for it to complete. Most people can&amp;#39;t be bothered to get out their credit card etc. and type in all the fiddly numbers to a Microsoft website that &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; only works in &lt;em&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/em&gt; or to actually go to a real shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, in reality, it&amp;#39;s easier to go to the Pirate Bay, download a cracked or otherwise version and burn it to a disc and slam it back into your computer. I put it to you, and I leave it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you soon (-ish, and that&amp;#39;s only if I&amp;#39;m not swamped in Christmas Homework), Alex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: *&lt;/em&gt;A few weeks after I reinstalled Windows 7, I got a message saying I needed to &amp;quot;Activate Windows&amp;quot;. I was apprehensive, but it said all I needed to do was call them. So I did. Here was the screen I got -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total I had to type in 54 numbers into my phone, then it sent another 54 numbers back by text which I then had to type into little text boxes. I can&amp;#39;t imagine Apple doing this to me. They know that people hate long fiddly numbers. But after that everything worked again. And hopefully it will be until I go over to Mac Laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mobile Catch-up Streaming and Stuff</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I lie. I actually do have time today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway - the BBC (if you don&amp;#39;t know who they are you can go die in a hole) FINALLY announced their iPlayer app for the iPhone. There has been an iPad app since February, and Android, but for some reason they had decided that an iPhone one wasn&amp;#39;t necessary. Or maybe they ran into technical difficulties. Either way, only now have the BBC got their act together. Here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/gfs4pzl&quot;&gt;very long article&lt;/a&gt; by the BBC talking about stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new iPlayer app joins the ranks of many others, including ITV Player, 4oD and Demand 5. Well, that leaves everyone in the UK being able to access all the major channels anywhere for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in reality, unless you have a very good (or expensive) phone contract, you&amp;#39;re not going to be streaming this over 3G. Such things would be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;massively expensive, and so you&amp;#39;re more likely to just use WiFi. But hey, there&amp;#39;s no problem with that. Let me refine my previous statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves everyone in the UK (with a phone) being able to access all the major channels anywhere there&amp;#39;s usable WiFi for (not so) nearly free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye - I have to learn a monologue for Drama (Drama Homework??!?) for the third-last day of term and it&amp;#39;s probably going to be an extract from Pygmalion, which we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;recently been studying in English. But whatever, it&amp;#39;s cool. Another app in the &amp;#39;Entertainment&amp;#39; folder on my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Quick Update</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the lack of blogging recently - I have been extremely busy over the last few weeks. If you&amp;#39;re interested, here&amp;#39;s a list of stuff I&amp;#39;ve done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filmed another school play. Made 114 DVDs on an iMac and a MacBook Pro, so very time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was backstage on a recent school production of Romeo and Juliet, which included Dubstep and 600 watt speakers. I am now interested in Dubstep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now heavily involved in a series of short plays known as &amp;quot;club drama&amp;quot;, both lighting and filming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also continued development on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pickture.me&quot;&gt;Pickture&lt;/a&gt; and my new bookmarking site... as well as updating my personal website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexforey.com&quot;&gt;alexforey.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfied? Enough excuses. Proper post coming on Thursday. Goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iTunes Store Blank on Windows 7 - Fix</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I usually don&amp;#39;t post on this kind of thing, but I felt compelled as I spent about a month or so trying to fix this damn problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now explain exactly what this problem was for anybody who wants to know or find out how to fix it themselves (which, let&amp;#39;s face it, you probably do because you&amp;#39;re reading this article).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that my iTunes store turns out to be completely blank (just white) except for the top bar, which correctly shows me my email, but nothing else, like the credit I have on the account. The rest of my iTunes worked perfectly, except of course that iTunes takes ages to start up on anything that isn&amp;#39;t stamped with that Apple logo of theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, sometimes it did load some content, but not enough to make it look like anything especially special... or even functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought that it was because I had previously &amp;quot;uninstalled&amp;quot; Internet Explorer. I say &amp;quot;uninstalled&amp;quot; because you actually can&amp;#39;t uninstall it, you can only &amp;quot;disable it as a Windows Feature&amp;quot;, but what the hell, it removes it from my list of programs so that&amp;#39;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no, I was wrong! Even after &amp;quot;reinstalling&amp;quot; that disgusting program, my iTunes store still doesn&amp;#39;t work. So I &amp;quot;re-uninstalled&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then uninstalled iTunes and Quicktime, and then re-installed iTunes and Quicktime, then made sure it was not blocked on any of my firewalls... usual stuff. This needed something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... more Apple Discussions browsing... until.... I found this lovely person&amp;#39;s response &lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3304371?start=0&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And so I came up with two solutions. The first one worked for me, but it might not for everyone so I am also including a fallback technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FIX 1. - Command Prompt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ever in doubt, Command Prompt usually fixed it. Enough waffle. Make sure iTunes  is closed. Type this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netsh winsock reset&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t restart computer - you don&amp;#39;t have to. Then open iTunes... and my iTunes store was as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FIX 2. - Some Microsoft Patch Crap Thing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t have to use it or anything, but just a link for people who are stuck still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9662461&quot;&gt;LINKY-MC-LINKERSON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Conclusion of Sorts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had, obviously, contacted Apple support. THEY WERE UTTERLY USELESS. I had written in my original support email exactly what was wrong, and exactly what machine / OS I was using and exactly what I had  already done. They effectively sent me a list of things that I had already done, and then said they couldn&amp;#39;t handle it and passed me onto the next guy in the chain. BORED. They offered me no solutions except uninstalling and re-installing iTunes. DAMN THEM. Quote time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I don&amp;#39;t have  a quote, because Apple say we&amp;#39;re not allowed to publish their emails... I wonder what that says about how confident they are...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIXED NOW. GOODBYE.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Deprecated HTML Tags</title>
				<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Separating content and styling is very powerful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I feel moderately strongly about is the use of tags which are specifically to do with presentation. I am therefore having a go at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will refer to these tags as the tags of doom, and I feel they are from an era when the web was made up of raw data. Paragraphs and headers. And lists. And tables. But not CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I love about CSS is that you can completely change the look of  a page without changing any of the markup. Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csszengarden.com/&quot;&gt;CSS Zen Garden&lt;/a&gt;. Look how completely the page changes when you change the stylesheet on the right (or possibly left) column. The tags of doom are part of the markup, and therefore when changing the stylesheet, these elements of the design would stay. Which I hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a new web, where websites contain so much more than content, I feel these tags have no place. You may ask why I am not having a go at the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; etc and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Well that is because they are still central to the design of every page. Search engines use them to figure out what kind of page it&amp;#39;s looking at. They cannot be replaced. But the tags of doom have been replaced by CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. I hate that too. It can be replaced by &lt;code&gt;margin: 0 auto;&lt;/code&gt; in CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Canon C300, Red Scarlet and some more thoughts</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So. So, so so. Canon announced the C300 and ... I&amp;#39;m assuming you know what that is. Let me explain further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canon C300 is a Cinema Motion Picture camera. It costs $20,000. It is not cheap. It has an EF and a PL lens mount, so you can use a crapton of lenses on it. With the release of the C300, Canon also released several new lenses, such as the Cinema 30-300mm EF lens. It looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/c300.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well - now you have all the knowledge you could possible need about that - on to the Red Epic. I mean Scarlet. Something else I must explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, in around 2009, the whole idea behind the Red Scarlet was that it would be the affordable on the Red Beasts. It was intended to be around $2,500-ish and it was gonna be awesome! For the same price as a DSLR, you could have a proper motion picture camera that would have all the features you&amp;#39;d expect and it would shoot at 3K! Sadly, only fixed lenses, but I&amp;#39;m sure they could have come up with something. This beast would have looked like this. I would have by all means bought one of these over a 5D mkII or a 7D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/scarlet-1.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But oh no. Red recently announced the official new Red Scarlet. It is basically a smaller version of the Red Epic, with less epic features (like only FPS up to 60 and only 4K resolution). On the upside you can have interchangeable lenses - so if you just happen to have a Red Epic or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.red.com/products/red-one&quot;&gt;Red One&lt;/a&gt; lying about - you could use those lenses instead - or you can buy a mount that allows you to attach any Canon lens to it for a mere $500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I still haven&amp;#39;t told you about the real problem with this new Scarlet. The price. At $10,000 - it&amp;#39;s not cheap. But if you buy only the &amp;#39;brain&amp;#39; as they call it (the rest of the world calls that a body) - it&amp;#39;s best and only use is as a paperweight. Why you ask me? Because after buying that - you also need to buy the LCD screen ($1,600), the battery ($500), the Red Mag (the only thing these cameras can record onto - $1,800), Red Station (the only way of getting this footage onto a computer - $250), some batteries ($515), side grip (for handheld - $950) and the list goes ON and ON and ON... But it does look cool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/scarlet-2.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is - to buy a functional Red Scarlet - you have to have around $16,000. Not so appealing any more. Ryan Connolly from Film Riot had some different thoughts on these cameras - which you can take a gander at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I have never actually touched any of these in real life - I&amp;#39;m basically going of spec sheets, but I leave you with one thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are these cameras really 5 times better than a Canon 5D mkII given they cost at least 5 times the price?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex, signing off.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Pace of Change - Comments and Ideas</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There is some interesting stuff in &lt;a href=&quot;http://matt.me63.com/2011/09/16/the-pace-of-change/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, and I have been set the task of commenting on it for homework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I will comment on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Moore’s Law says nothing about what people will do with that exponential power. Whether playing ‘Pong’ or ‘Call of Duty’ we still have the same cognitive capacities and number of eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this to ring true about practically everything that Man, homo sapiens, has ever made. Take a hammer. You can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at it, wondering what on earth it is for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kill people with it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use it to make things that help the development of Man&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now apply this concept to computers, and also to the general idea of progress. Even though this is about 3000 years after the first &amp;#39;hammer&amp;#39; was invented, here are things you can do with a computer, and indeed people are doing with computers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stare at it in amazement, wondering what on earth it is for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use it to communicate with other people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use it to take down the Pentagon (although not many people can do this)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make stuff with it - as I have done &lt;a href=&quot;http://pickture.me&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://spellme.site50.net&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.duckhouseproductions.co.uk&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/DuckHouseProductions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmandstuff.co.uk&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Well actually, the list goes on, but I couldn&amp;#39;t be bothered to list all of them.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And therefore, there comes a point when further development of the computer is pointless, because the human mind cannot harness its power (unless just performing mathematical calculations, but that&amp;#39;s boring) because eventually computers will become more powerful than the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, how is it possible to measure the power of  the human brain? Another problem with these random statistics appears. These things are abstract, and therefore cannot be measured scientifically against the absolute power of a computer, in GHz, petaflops or amount of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We come back again to the idea of not being able to harness the enormous amount of power on these new computers predicted by Moore&amp;#39;s law. Or maybe - we will be able to harness it, but we won&amp;#39;t do anything productive with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m off to play &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.totaljerkface.com/happy_wheels.php&quot;&gt;Happy Wheels&lt;/a&gt;. I could do this on a $200 netbook or I could do this on a $25,000 Mac Pro. Or I could do this on a $1,000,000 super-computer. Provided they all have Flash installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Windows 8 Hands-on Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, I will start with my general opinion of where Windows, and Microsoft, seem to be going. Unfortunately, they seem to be deliberately moving away from Apple and OS X... trying to be different in their own &amp;#39;special&amp;#39; kind of way. I think this was a fundamental mistake. It&amp;#39;s not that I do not like Microsoft products, I think that Windows 7 was one of the best operating systems in the world in terms of performance - not necessarily looks - but definitely performance. But I was (not very) recently, after installing &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmandstuff.co.uk/33-lion&quot;&gt;OS X Lion&lt;/a&gt;, struck by how well it just worked. And it does look better than Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick look at the Windows 8 Start Page (pictured below) one thing struck me. Windows Phone. Why would you do that to a desktop operating system? To me it makes no sense whatsoever. If you don&amp;#39;t believe me, take a look at the photo below it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/windows-phone.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much deliberation on the reason for this bad idea, I have concluded that Windows 8 is intended to be run heavily on tablets. But, as with everything Microsoft makes, there are several problems with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, why on earth would you make a desktop operating system that is designed to run on tablets? The very idea is absurd. This is because an operating system has to be designed in a way that users of previous versions will be able to interact with in a conventional fashion. But the problem runs deeper than this. It might, just might, mean that Microsoft is focusing more on their mobile operating system because they think that is the way of the future - and therefore they could save some design work by just copying over some of the graphics files. This may sound harsh, but I am trying to get my message across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second problem with this idea is that Windows 8 actually can&amp;#39;t run on most tablets, because they need minimum screen resolution of 1024x768 to run their new metro-style apps. This means that the tablets themselves have to be more expensive, because that&amp;#39;s a lot of pixels to fit on a 5&amp;quot; to 7&amp;quot; screen. There&amp;#39;s an article on Life Hacker, specifically about this topic &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/5841489/how-to-fix-windows-8-apps-not-launching&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People may criticize this argument. But I do think there is something fundamentally wrong with making an operating system that is designed to run on tablets and desktops (and laptops, obviously) simultaneously, as the platforms are SO different. And, now it won&amp;#39;t even run on most current Windows 7 tablets, you effectively get the worst of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fairly average stuff. There are three builds to download: 32-bit, 64-bit, and 64-bit with developer tools (basically Visual Studio 2011). So you download the massive (5BG-ish) ISO from their standard HTTP server,which for me took around an hour. Then you do something with it. You can either install it nativley (which I would not recommend now), or you can run it in a Virtual Machine, using something like VMWare Workstation or Oracle VirtualBox. But there is a catch. For some reason unknown to man, it is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to run any version of Windows 8 in VMWare Workstation 7.x . So upgrade, or give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, once you have successfully installed it, which does take quite a long time, you can finally start playing with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Start Screen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel I have ranted about this enough, in the previous section. I don&amp;#39;t particularly like the way it looks, and I don&amp;#39;t really like the functionality either. I prefer the desktop, which you can only get to by clicking on one of the panels. I suppose you could be called old-fashioned. But I don&amp;#39;t really care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing I really hate about the start screen is this. Once you have clicked on the &amp;#39;Desktop&amp;#39; panel you arrive at the desktop. Pretty standard. So now I&amp;#39;m just going to click on the start menu and BAM. I&amp;#39;m back at the f***ing start screen again. What did I do wrong? Oh - I see. I have to hover over the start button to get the start menu. If I click on it I go back to where I just came from. NOT FUNNY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;General Functionality.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only got a few words to say. Internet Explorer still is not a modern browser. Everything else is the same as Windows 7. Except the fact that there appear to be two control panels, which is very confusing. And - I like the new Task Manager. It gives you more power to end them processes when Windows 8 can&amp;#39;t cope with them. Overall, not very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Backwards Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything what works with Windows 7 works with Windows 8. In most cases, everything that works with XP works with Windows 8. (Let&amp;#39;s just forget Vista shall we?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, although I may be called harsh, I cannot really see the point of Windows 8. It seems to fall in the cycle with all other Windows operating systems. Good - bad - good - bad. Example: Windows 2000 (Bad) - Windows XP (Good) - Windows Vista (Bad) - Windows 7 (Good) - Windows 8 (Bad) etc....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that if Windows continues to continue in this direction - Apple will win. Full stop. Because, even though some features have come across from iPad to Mac, no features except for some names, like Safari, have ever gone from Mac to iPad. Apple has realized that iOS and OS X should stay separate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 itself is basically just Windows 7, and the world will soon be all Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Reflections on the Internet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Every day I am more astounded by the power of the Internet. It&amp;#39;s power to connect people, services and more. Here are two things that I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about recently. (FYI this post is full of videos)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;YouTube&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every minute, twenty-four hours of video is uploaded to YouTube. That means that it is physically impossible to watch all the video currently on YouTube either now or in the future. Think about that next time your video gets more than a few thousand views. People hardly ever come across videos on YouTube accidentally. People watch your video because other people have watched your video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Facebook ever end? I know that MySpace used to be massively popular - but look at it now. But somehow I can&amp;#39;t see that happening to Facebook. It is simply too popular. Why would you leave when all your friends are on Facebook? With 800,000,000 active users I can&amp;#39;t see it going anywhere soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Internet of Things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this topic really needs it&amp;#39;s own post, but I don&amp;#39;t really have time. All I want to say about the Internet of Things is this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will life be like in 25 years time? What was life like 25 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Magical Programming Languages and Where to Find Them</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A slightly off-topic post - this blog is meant to be about Film after all...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many, many different programming languages out there, and they all have different uses. I will cover some of the main ones, because I can&amp;#39;t be bothered to do all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;HTML&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most fundamental and easiest of programming languages. Every single web page on the internet is using some form of HTML when it displays content out to the user. This blog is using HTML to display text, and it has LOADS of basic tags, such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;br&gt; and &lt;img&gt; and some more, and some more. HTML code is sent to the browser and is then rendered by the browser for you to see. Different browsers render this differently, as you can see if you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmandstuff.co.uk/2011/09/browsers/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on browsers. Relatively recently, HTML5 was released with a whole load of awesome features, and you can see a summary of those new features&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;JavaScript&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be confused with Java, this is code run in the browser on triggers sent by the user or the DOM: meaning you can run a function to do something when the page is ready or when you press a button (or similar). JavaScript is mostly used for clever programming, like figuring out statistics every time you change a number in a box or something. Did you know that Google Analytics relies on JavaScript, as every time someone loads a page with a tracking code on it, the little piece of code that you paste into your page sends a web request to an engine in Google that receives a whole load of data about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jQuery which runs on JavaScript is awesome, and allows you to do so many cool things in a way that makes you think &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s how the web should work&amp;quot;. Go do some more research if you don&amp;#39;t know what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some problems with JavaScript, such as the fact that it can be switched off by the user. This can be fatal if using it as a spam filter, or as form validation. People have had servers crashed by spammers getting past JavaScript - so be warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;CSS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what is known as the styling of the web. CSS allows you to completely change the way a page looks without changing any HTML. Entire blogs have been created specifically about CSS, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://css-tricks.com&quot;&gt;CSS-Tricks&lt;/a&gt;, and empowers the web to look awesome. If you want to make anything on the web, GO LEARN CSS. It&amp;#39;s also rendered in the browser, so really old web browsers won&amp;#39;t support the latest CSS3 features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;PHP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP is a server language, and therefore no matter what browser/computer you have, this language will not change. What does matter though, is having PHP installed on your server. This makes a difference because PHP is processed on the server every time you make a request, even before the page is sent to the browser. This blog runs on PHP, and because what you are actually looking at is some text that has been pulled from a database, when you send the request for this page, PHP figures out what you&amp;#39;re looking for, gets it from the database, and then sends it to your browser. That means that PHP itself does not change no matter what device you view it on. A very interesting language, I would recommend adding this to your programming tool-belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;VB.NET&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of Microsoft&amp;#39;s languages, that runs from the .NET Framework. Don&amp;#39;t ask me how it works, if you&amp;#39;re interested you can go look it up. VB.NET is used to make desktop programs, such as my Scribe, which is currently on the brink of release. Unlike the rest of these languages, you have to download a program to make programs, instead of using a regular text editor. There are other similar programming languages that run on the same framework such as C#.NET and F#.NET, but I won&amp;#39;t go into those. Once you have finished making a program, you have to build it for release, then you can save it as a ZIP and ship it for people to download. Before anyone can run your program, they have to have the relevant version of the .NET Framework running on their machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written 722 words so far, and it&amp;#39;s getting late, and I&amp;#39;m getting bored. After all, programming is like an off-hobby for me. Good night.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>DIY Fig Rig</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some of you may know that I love to build things, especially camera gear which would otherwise cost thousands of pounds. The professional Fig Rig is made my Manfrotto, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Manfrotto-595B-Fig-Rig/dp/B000LRFURU/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1319129001&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;you can buy it here&lt;/a&gt; if you really want to, although considering how simple the design is, I can&amp;#39;t figure out why this is so expensive other than the fact that it has a Manfrotto sticker on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I decided to follow the instructions of Indy Mogul&amp;#39;s sadly finished internet show, Backyard FX. Here is the video I loosely followed to get my design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/qT72hoYxESI?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in the UK, specific PVC fittings like the ones shown in the video are actually quite hard to come by. Luckily, I found some on ScrewFix, so if anyone out there wants to know where to find them, just search for PVC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had completed the basic structure, I decided to customize it. After having previous bad experiences with PVC and black spray paint, I decided not to take that option but to simply buy some cheap red electricians tape, and covered all the joints in it to give it a more awesome feel. As I couldn&amp;#39;t find any PVC cross-pieces, I modded the design slightly in order to allow me to use another T piece instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some other cool features, such as the ability to flip the camera upside down in order to get really close to the ground, and I also built mine specifically so I could access the battery and card compartments while the camera was attached to the Fig Rig. To attach my camera to the Fig Rig, I simply drilled a 6mm hole on the opposite wall of the T from the bit that sticks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fig-rig.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all I think this works very well, and when combined with some stabilization from After Effects or the like, creates virtually perfect tracking shots. Again a video, this time of some test footage from my Youtube account, DuckHouseProductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/SYiSyDHCNHM?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this cost me between £15 and £25 and I am very pleased with the results. If you wanna get some stable shots, no matter what camera you have, I highly recommend investing the time and effort into making one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>After the Move</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;To anybody who was following me before the switch to our own domain, I have had some problems but they are all cleared up now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first registered the domain, and then spent ages navigating the stupid menus until I found the place to change the name-servers. Once I set those, it took around 3 hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off using 000Webhost, which went quite badly, because when I installed Wordpres it kept returning errors about operations timing out. I submitted a support ticket about the PHP errors, but they just told be to upgrade to Premium, which seems to be their answer to everything. I also tried different themes, but again I had problems with the server returning an empty result (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=7d50c093bd4f8f6c&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fid=7d50c093bd4f8f6c0004ac782d9b44b2&amp;amp;hltp=2&quot;&gt;Chrome Error 324&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I gave up and upped sticks for the far more reliable x10 Hosting option. It then took me another 4 hours to change the name-servers again, and for me to flush my DNS cache to make sure everything had worked as planned. Once I got that working, I installed WordPress 3.2.1 again and installed my favorite theme &amp;#39;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalnature.eu/themes/mystique/&quot;&gt;Mystique&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39; 3.1 directly from that website. I also went about exporting all the content from the old site and importing it into the new one, and editing theme settings to my liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, move over, we can get back to doing what a blog is meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Lowepro Flipside 300 Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/flipside-1.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after recently buying &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmandstuff.co.uk/2011/10/lens-review/&quot;&gt;a second lens&lt;/a&gt; to go with my AWESOME  second-hand Canon EOS 300, I felt that I needed a proper camera bag to go with it. As some of you might know, I do commercial work for my school, and each time I do I usually get paid enough to buy a new piece of gear, which is how I managed to fork out for this definitely not inexpensive camera bag. But it also got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning to do some more work for them soon, I will probably be able to afford another lens soon. Therefore, I should buy a bag that has enough space for any sensible future purchases. I also wanted to get a good quality, reliable and trusted make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that pointed me to a Lowepro, and the best size for me would be the 200 or the 202 depending on the series. Then, I decided that there were three different models that I would consider - the Fastpack, the Slingshot and the Flipside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went into my local branch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jessops.com&quot;&gt;Jessops&lt;/a&gt; to compare them, only to be greeted by a rather patronizing member of staff. So I ignored them, because I seemed to know more then they did, and looked for the bags. There were several drawbacks that I noticed about the other two bags - the Fastpack seemed to have very little space for a camera considering how big the bag actually was, and the Slingshot only had one strap. Not a good idea if I&amp;#39;m going to be carrying it around for several hours on the tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to buy a Flipside, but on looking at the prices in Jessops, immediately left and headed straight for Amazon, where I found, to my astonishment, that the Flipside 200 was more expensive than the 300. So I bought that one instead, and it arrived two days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have explained my choice of bag, I will get round to the review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, Lowepro is known for it&amp;#39;s reliability and durability, and this is no exception. Just from the look of it, I can tell that it;s not going to fall to pieces any time soon, in comparison to one of Jessops&amp;#39; own brand products, which felt like it might disintegrate without too much difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flipside is unique among bags as it opens from the side that faces your back. This has three main advantages - firstly it is far more secure in crowded places as it is impossible for anything to be surreptitiously lifted from your bag, a real plus if you&amp;#39;re carrying gear worth four figures. The second advantage is that with most camera bags, in order to extract your gear you have to put the bag on the ground with the side that usually touches your back on the ground, meaning that when you put it back on again, any dirt that was on the ground goes straight onto your clothes. Thirdly, with the waist strap, it is now possible to get to your gear without actually taking the bag off. All you have to do is take off the arm straps and swivel the bag round to your front, so you can use your bag a little like a table. This may be hard to imagine this - so here is a photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/flipside-2.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bag is a bit like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS&quot;&gt;Tardis&lt;/a&gt;, in that despite being very compact and slim on the outside, it has a vast, cavernous space inside. There should be plenty of space for my current and future camera gear, including two bodies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canon EOS 300 Film SLR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canon EF 28-90mm Kit Lens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIgma 70-300mm &amp;#39;Consumer-Grade&amp;#39; Lens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorillapod SLR Zoom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velbon CX4780 Video Tripod (more about that later)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;del&gt;Future&lt;/del&gt;) Canon EOS 600D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;del&gt;Future&lt;/del&gt;) Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 (otherwise known as the &lt;em&gt;fantastic plastic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;del&gt;Future&lt;/del&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CDcQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rodemic.com%2F&amp;amp;ei=eQ-fTsbXGsOQ4gTd8qSYCQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGYmD9vWSEMPUNoPcE2y2AJi1czJA&amp;amp;sig2=rlw-lt07SopBIem9Tp5PeQ&quot;&gt;RØDE Videomic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a picture (from DigitalCameraReview) of the interior with gear pretty similar to my own:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/flipside-3.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there&amp;#39;s plenty of room for around five lenses, let alone three. You can also see that there is a massive pouch at the top for random accessories like a Lenspen or some filters, which can be removed if you wish, allowing for a super-long lens to be attached to the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a final note, there are some little pockets on the outside for storing items such as memory cards and perhaps the odd instruction manual or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very trusty bag. I would highly recommend it. You may be paying a lot, but I strongly advise you to not take the cheap way out and buy a crappy own-brand from a shop. Lowepro FTW.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Some more OSx86</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;OK, OK. I gave up the first time. But now I have the time, I&amp;#39;m gonna give iAtkos a go. I gave up with the Lion, and now I have even given up with Snow Leopard, so I am resorting to Leopard. This might work. MIGHT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, I always have Windows 8... oh wait, that&amp;#39;s crap. What have they done to the start screen? Ruined it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex, signing off, will report back soon.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Lens Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Now for the first post about what this blog was originally intended for - a review of something relevant to filmmaking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sigma-70-300.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am reviewing the Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 DG Macro. That&amp;#39;s a long name, but it&amp;#39;s needed because Sigma do three 70-300mm lenses, all around the same price range, and all looking fairly similar. There are also some competing models from both Tamron and Canon (because I use Canon I can&amp;#39;t be bothered to review the Nikon one, but all these lenses word with Nikon as well) They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigma 70-300mm DG Macro (My one, £130)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigma 70-300mm APO DG Macro (It has a red ring :O, £180)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigma 70-300mm DG OS (No red ring, £230)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamron 70-300mm AF LD  (£100)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canon 70-300mm AF EF (£240)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of these, I chose the one in bold. I shall give you some reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall say first that I currently own a Canon EOS 300. That means not a digital one, a film one, and I currently have plans to buy a Canon 600D. It is therefore necessary that this lens fit both a Full Frame Censor (the film one) and a APS-C sensor (the cropped digital one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, when I walked into a shop (yes, I still do that kind of thing) and asked to check if the Sigma 1. fitted on my camera, I was immediately struck by the great build quality of the lens: it felt reassuringly heavy, but not too heavy. It also has a metal mount, meaning it is less likely to break off the camera by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I asked to compare it with the Tamron, and it was really a pointless question. For only £30 more, you get a lot more quality, although I would argue that the Tamron looks nicer, but that&amp;#39;s really irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn&amp;#39;t buy the others was mainly for price - I was trying to buy the best lens I could for under £150, and I definitely chose the right one. But, if unlike me the money doesn&amp;#39;t matter so much, I would go for the APO DG, mainly because of the better quality glass, and, or course, that red ring :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing - the Macro on the end of the name actually does mean something. If you zoom in to between 200 and 300mm, you can switch on Macro mode, allowing you to focus up to 1.5m away from the camera, and allows a Macro ratio of 1:2, just for any wildlife photographers out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would post a video, but I couldn&amp;#39;t find any decent ones about this specific lens. More to come soon - I&amp;#39;m buying  a bigger camera bag to fit all this gear into, and I&amp;#39;ll post a review on that when I have decided.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Adobe touches on Apps</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/adobe-touch.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So finally Adobe has started developing for mobile devices. Previously, their best attempt was Photoshop Lite or somesuch, but now things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adobe have finally realized their potential when it comes to utilizing the ever growing potential of tablets, and specifically the iPad 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Apps look incredible, in fact they look as if they could be the best Apps ever made. And, they&amp;#39;re reasonably priced, too. At only $10 or £6, you can buy one without the risk of hating it so much that you think you should never have bought it. Then, if you do like it, then you could buy the rest of them. The thing that Adobe might want to think about is something in the style of an App Suite, meaning if you know you want to buy all of them, they could give you a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very smart marketing move, after the massive mistake Adobe made when it unveiled Muse as a subscription only service. This sparked a massive debate and many potential users decided not to buy. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.muse.adobe.com/muse/topics/why_is_muse_sold_by_subscription_only&quot;&gt;take a dip into that conversation here&lt;/a&gt;, but don&amp;#39;t be surprised if the page takes half an hour to load because of how long it is. Look! A video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But definitely, I will try these out as soon as I get an iPad. Which may be some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title&amp;#39;s funny, cos they&amp;#39;re called Adobe Touch Apps.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Some Free Stuff</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;On a lighter note, you may be interested in my new selection of free givaways on my website - Duck House Productions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://duckhouseproductions.co.uk/free-stuff&quot;&gt;Go to the page of downloadable goodiness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have created several unique and original desktop backgrounds. But these are no ordinary desktop backgrounds. They are editable PSDs, with a ridiculously high resolution to fit nearly any screen (including the 27&amp;quot; iMac). They also have instructions about how to change it to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, some music. Although this is not originally created by me, I have tweaked it and edited it to suite my needs, and what I think might be useful to others. Full credit is given where it is due to the original artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there are some templates, for storyboards etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Remembering Steve Jobs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/steve-jobs.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it would be fair to say that the world was shaken today by the death of Apple&amp;#39;s founder, Steve Jobs. This was entirely unexpected - people knew he was ill, seriously ill, but the general idea was that he was in a stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs could have been one of the most successful and busy men the earth has seen today. He co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. Through his time at Apple, it is possible to say that he was one of the great master-minds behind nearly every single product, from the G2 way back in the day to the iPhone 4 (but sadly not the 4S). That means that he had a major role in developing pretty much everything that you could walk into an Apple shop and see, and everything on their website. This man had a very active life, so one might have thought that he would pull through better than he did, but you never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1986, after being effectively kicked out of Apple, Steve Jobs buys PIXAR, the computer animation company behind titles such as the Toy Story series, Flushed Away and many others. He revolutionized it and lead it to a state where he could successfully sell it to Disney, at a great profit. At this point, he returned to Apple and completely revolutionized that too - he brought Apple to the state it is in today, with some of the most innovative and imaginative and ultimately useful pieces of technology around at any time. He thought up the idea of putting the letter &amp;#39;i&amp;#39; before devices, to suggest integration with the internet, but now they have evolved into so much more - the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. These devices have revolutionized the world we live in today, and for that we should remember him as one of the pioneers of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an interesting video, made by ABC News, remembering Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ft3oPgsCFbA?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a final note, Apple has just published &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.apple.com/uk/stevejobs/&quot;&gt;a page on their website &lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate how much he meant to all the people at Apple, and if you want to pay your respects, you can send Apple an email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:rememberingsteve@apple.com&quot;&gt;rememberingsteve@apple.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Google Docs has it's only disadvantage removed</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Google created a function on Google Docs that basically gets rid of any competition. Many people thought that the disadvantage with Google Docs is that you can only access your files when you are browsing them online. But no anymore... pause for effect. Google has made a new Google Chrome Docs App, which allows you to view your files (yes view, not change) that are stored on the Google server even when you are not connected to the internet. This is a slightly befuddling concept, and this is how Google explains it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Google Docs offline work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve set up Google Docs offline, and can now view Google documents and spreadsheets even when you don&amp;#39;t have an Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Available Offline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offline access is available only for documents and spreadsheets. When you have Google Docs open and have an Internet connection, your most recently opened documents and spreadsheets will sync and become available offline. Presentations, drawings and other items are not currently available offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;View-Only&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time, documents and spreadsheets are available in view-only mode. You must restore your Internet connection to make any edits. In addition, you can&amp;#39;t create new Docs while you&amp;#39;re offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Browser&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Docs are available offline only in the Chrome browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offline access is allowed on a computer-by-computer basis. Anyone with access to a computer where you’ve enabled offline access will be able to view your synced documents and spreadsheets when they open Chrome. To protect your data, &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;#39;t allow offline access on public or shared computers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, please see the Google Docs Help Center when you regain access to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that&amp;#39;s pretty awesome. You&amp;#39;ll never have compatibility problems ever again. Remember that currently you can&amp;#39;t write to these files, but Google says that&amp;#39;s coming soon. Office, iWork and OpenOffice don&amp;#39;t stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Reporting Back - OS X on VMWare</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well... no it didn&amp;#39;t work. It installed alright, rebooted fine, but when I come to the page on the first boot cycle that says &amp;#39;Already have a mac?&amp;#39; I click no, then it freezes. It gets completely stuck. So I go along to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=97935&quot;&gt;forum page here&lt;/a&gt; and try to boot in single user mode, but then when it comes to that part while booting, it doesn&amp;#39;t give me a chance to press F8 to enter boot parameters. So now I&amp;#39;m trying back with a new bootloader: Darwin&lt;em&gt;snow&lt;/em&gt;legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will report back soon, Alex signing off.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Install OS X Snow Leopard on Windows 7 Using VMWare</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;OK. I have tried for weeks to get a Hackintosh working, using many methods, and because my computer has an AMD Phenom II processor it is even harder, because OS X was never designed to work with AMD. I eventually gave up trying to install this natively on my computer, so I turned to virtual&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I had the issue of enabling virtualization. I know for a fact that my processor supports this, and I also know that at least one of my two graphics cards supports this as well. So I think well that sounds fine, so I go into my BIOS &amp;gt; System Configuration and look for the option to turn it on. But OH NO, HP hates anyone who tries to do clever things with their computers, so not only did they disable Virtualization when it came out of the factory, they also REMOVED THE OPTION TO ENABLE IT. So I do what anybody would have done in this situation, and contact HP support. I will quote the email exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Alex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for contacting HP Customer Care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand from your e-mail that you own a HP Pavilion dv6-3113sa Entertainment Notebook PC and wish to enable the virtualization feature in BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex, The hardware virtualization feature is disabled in BIOS from factory. There is no option to tun this feature ON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For information on keeping your HP and Compaq products up and running, please visit our website at: http://www.hp.co.uk/diagnostics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP Customer Care&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How useless is that? She even misspelt &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot;. So I go turn to the online forums, where I finally find an answer! Someone says that I should &amp;#39;restore the bios to defaults&amp;#39;. So I do this, and lo an behold, nothing happens. So I was about to give up when I decide to go back into bios and for the hell of it just enable everything. And guess what. It worked. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I tried the way of doing it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-install-os-x-snow-leopard-in-vmware-windows-7-9140301/&quot;&gt;this tutorial here&lt;/a&gt;, and finally found that I could get it to install. But still, once it installed and rebooted, it would refuse to work. Although I managed to get this screenshot, which is pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vmware-osx.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, after many days of downloading, I am following &lt;a href=&quot;www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF1s94f2W1Q&quot;&gt;this video tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to be well structured and clear, in the hope that by tomorrow, I may have a working Mac OS X 10.6.8 installed in VMware Workstation 7, on Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will report back soon.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Happens when Google Goes Wrong</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post - I thought this might amuse some -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/google-maps-directions.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This most likely was put in by someone at Google trying to see if anyone would notice, a bit like the hidden messages about Bill Gates in the spellchecker of Microsoft Word 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Browsing Browsers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So there have been many, many browsers over the years, but for those people unsure, I will start with what a browser actually is. This is not as stupid as you might think - have a look at this video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/o4MwTvtyrUQ?color=white&amp;theme=light&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a lot has changed since then - even though that was not very long ago. As they don&amp;#39;t actually explain in the video, a browser is a program installed on your computer that allows you to view the web - it is not a search engine, it is not a website, it is a program. There are several main browsers out there, some that come with your computer and some that don&amp;#39;t (all versions newest) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Internet Explorer 9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla Firefox 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opeara 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safari 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous mobile browsers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer is the default that comes with Windows, and Safari comes with Macs. Here is a graph of world usage of browsers in August 2011 (pretty recent then):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/browser-graph.svg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many arguments over the years as to which browser is the best, and my verdict is Google Chrome. This is simply because it is a lighter program - meaning that it takes up less CPU (processing power) on your computer, meaning it can launch faster and use less battery power on a laptop. It also has sync, which allows you to synchronize all your bookmarks, themes, extensions and even auto-fill and password data. This is all encrypted before being stored on the &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; so that no-one except you can reach it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also other reasons why some browsers are better than others. This is usually because of the way that they display web pages. Internet Explorer uses its own &amp;quot;render engine&amp;quot; to take something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;example&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Hello&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; world!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Having a great &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;day&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;?&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And makes it look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello&lt;/strong&gt; world!&lt;/em&gt; Having a great &lt;strong&gt;day&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different &amp;quot;render engines&amp;quot; make pages look different if they use some code that has not been covered by that &amp;quot;render engine&amp;quot;. There is a handy tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://browserlab.adobe.com&quot;&gt;BrowserLab&lt;/a&gt;, that allows you to see what your website will look like on different browsers without having to have them all installed on your computer. For instance, here is my URL shortener, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drop.x10.bz&quot;&gt;DropURL&lt;/a&gt; as viewed in Internet Explorer 6 vs Chrome 13:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/browserlab.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly I have to do some cross-browser compatibility improvement. IE6 has become the nemesis of many web designers because of firstly how bad it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;render engine&amp;quot; is and secondly how many people are still using it, despite the fact that it is over 10 years old. There is an interesting article on why they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://css-tricks.com/820-why-people-still-use-ie-6/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;render engine&amp;quot; is bad because it does not support &lt;a href=&quot;http://webdesign.about.com/od/beginningcss/a/aa021607.htm&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;, a way of making websites look awesome, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://javascript.about.com/od/reference/p/javascript.htm&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, which allows web pages to be interactive and do clever things. In fact, I like that so much I&amp;#39;m gonna make it into a quotation so other people can quote me on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML makes a website, CSS makes it look cool, Javascript makes it interactive and do clever things, and PHP makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I haven&amp;#39;t even touched on Mobile Browsers, which in themselves deserve a whole other post, but I can&amp;#39;t be bothered to do that, so here is a mini version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been trying to optimize their websites for mobile device browsers a lot recently. In the past, the webpage would just detect (using JavaScript) if you were using a mobile device and redirect you to another website with the same content, just a different way of displaying it, more suited to smaller screens. An example - &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com&quot;&gt;Youtube &lt;/a&gt;vs &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.youtube.com&quot;&gt;m.Yotube&lt;/a&gt;. The problem with this is that every time you want to make a new page, you have to do it twice, once on the normal site and once on the mobile site. Now, however, everything has changed. People are now making intelligent websites, that will change fluently as you resize your browser window to emulate a mobile device. Take a look &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediaquiri.es&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, click on a website, and see what happens when you make the windows bigger and smaller. There are also other ways of making a website more mobile-friendly, like making images few and far-between, to make download speeds on pages faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I have sufficiently covered this topic. If you feel not, feel free to comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Musings about Muse</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So Adobe Muse has been hitting the &amp;quot;headlines&amp;quot; of blogs all over the world, but as far as I can see it has never once appeared in a real newspaper here in the UK. This is strange, as it could be the turning point on the retail of all Adobe products, used by millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adobe Muse, if you don&amp;#39;t already know, is a WYSIWYG website editor, and has been dubbed &amp;quot;Photoshop for Websites&amp;quot;. In reality is it more likely to be &amp;quot;InDesign for Websites&amp;quot;, but that&amp;#39;s more a matter of opinion. Basically, you design your website, set where the boundaries of the header and footer are, and it will generate the code that will work in any &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; browser. I say it generated code, but it is really more powerful than that, for instance if you rotate an image in Muse, it will generate a rotated version of your image, framed in the transparent box of a PNG. So it also renders images, as well as code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been criticized by many web designers and coders alike, mainly because of the way it spews out &lt;div&gt; tags with no regard for code structure. For instance, here is some code from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.duckhouseproductions.co.uk&quot;&gt;Duck House Website&lt;/a&gt;, made with Muse :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/muse-div.jpg &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it goes on and on for (believe it or not) 1076 lines. Just for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dhp.png &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, there are also other bad web standards conventions, like making a new class for every single new style, which clutters your code with meaningless drivel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more personal problems I have with Muse is that every page has two of its own CSS files - on for &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; browsers and one for &amp;quot;special and mentally diseased&amp;quot; browsers (ie IE, hey they&amp;#39;re the same!). It is also infinitely difficult to update your master page, because when exporting the changes it has to change 2x the amount of pages in stylesheets and a master one. That means if you have 100 pages, and you make a tiny change to the master template, it will have to update 201 CSS documents. This kind of defeats the point of CSS which is that in order to make a site-wide change, you only have to change one file, But no - Muse has to make it more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muse, after the end of this year, will cease to be in beta. That means that it will no longer be a free testing service, and that means that you will have to pay. BUT Adobe has decided that instead of being able to pay for Muse outright once, you have to subscribe for $20 per month. I guess this is because Adobe feels that people will dump the program unless they offer updates every few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the reason for the hideous code. Because Adobe doesn&amp;#39;t want you to spend $20, make your website, stop using Muse, and continue to edit the code to change your website for ever more. You have to keep using Muse to maintain your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, Muse is great for InDesign experts (or anybody) who wants to make a static site quickly and put it up on the web quickly. But they don&amp;#39;t want to ever change it again. Without paying a ridiculous monthly cost. The verdict: download Muse, put it on an offline computer, and ship the exported HTML files onto an online computer to upload the files.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Editing Programs and the Arguments they Bring (and FCP X)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may know that I make films. Hopefully you&amp;#39;ve got the hint from the name of this blog. If not then maybe you shouldn&amp;#39;t be here. Anyway, as you probably know there are three main stages to making a film - pre-production (scripting, casting and other planning etc..), production (shooting) and post-production (editing, VFX and distribution etc...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the crucial stage, editing, the whole outcome of the film can be decided. Therefore, people have to make sure that they use reliable, stable programs that won&amp;#39;t crash on them at the last minute. There are a great many programs that fit this bill, but which is the best? This argument is probably a.) the most long and b.) the most pointless argument in the history of filmmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the three main competitors in this so-called &amp;quot;fight&amp;quot; are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Premiere Pro (by Adobe, latest version CS5.5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final Cut Pro (by Apple, latest version 7 or X depending)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media Composer (by Avid, latest version 5.5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, all the companies begin with A. This has nothing to do with what I&amp;#39;m actually talking about, but I thought it was interesting). Secondly, they all support roughly the same file formats and they all have roughly the same features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the main difference is that PrPro and Media Composer work on Mac and Windows, but FCP only runs on Macs. This is mainly because Apple make Macs and Apple makes FCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable difference is that PrPro can work with pretty much any raw files (files that come straight off a camera) natively (with out conversion) but the other two can&amp;#39;t. This is a great advantage for people who use lots of different types of cameras (and especially DSLRs) and need a quick production workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, onto FCP X. For most users, it is a very good and useful piece of software. In fact, after getting to know it a bit more, you may find this better than FCP 7. But I&amp;#39;m afraid to say that it&amp;#39;s just not very stable. I wouldn&amp;#39;t trust it with any commercial work for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no re-connect media.  This means that if (for instance) you realize you&amp;#39;re running out of hard drive space and you move all your footage to a new location, FCP X will decide that you need to completely restart your project from scratch. Not good. I have also heard that occasionally it will just &amp;#39;loose your footage&amp;#39; itself, meaning that you have no way of continuing your project : you have to restart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It no longer supports multi-cam edits. During a (not so) recent project &amp;#39;Ratz&amp;#39;, I was using four cameras to film a play in the round. Luckily, due to PrPro&amp;#39;s multi-cam thing, all I needed to do was sync my four cameras once at the beginning, then run the multi-cam window and just play through, clicking on the angle I wanted, much like a virtual gallery. It is also included in FCP 7 and AMC, But no, this tool was denied to us in FCP X. This means that I would have had to re-sync the cameras every time I wanted to change from one camera to another, which must have been about 100 times in 120 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are also other grouches I have with FCP X. For one thing, it does look a lot like iMovie &amp;#39;11. This in itself is not a bad thing, but considering you&amp;#39;re paying over £300 for it, I would hope they coudl improve some of the graphics etc... although I do think that it&amp;#39;s rolling shutter filter (again the same as iMovie) is the best in the world (although maybe not since the introduction of the Warp Stabilizer in After Effects CS5.5, I&amp;#39;ll have to do some tests on that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the real problem is that FCP X behaves like a consumer program (iMovie) but is trying to fill the boots of a much more professional piece of kit, which it fails to do miserably. So, for me at least, I won&amp;#39;t be using it for anything on which I&amp;#39;m on a deadline or anything that I&amp;#39;m doing for not myself. FCP X has been dubbed iMovie Pro and iMovie on steroids, which is perhaps not as unfair as it might seem.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>OS X Lion</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello All&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So.. OS X Lion. It&amp;#39;s not a new thing, but I decided to try it out. So I did. It&amp;#39;s by no stretch of the imagination an expensive upgrade - only £20.99 on the Mac App Store and about $30 in the US. It is a very large download (nearly 4GB) - so it might not be a good idea to go download it at your local cafe - you&amp;#39;ll probably be there for more than two hours and the managers will start to get suspicious. Once you have downloaded it, it&amp;#39;s quite simple to install - just run the setup. (*All users except the user running the setup have to be logged out.) After that, it will take about 15 mins to install, shutdown, restart and then take a further 30 mins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to the actual contents of this new OS. The things that might notice first of all are the GUI changes. For instance, the logon screen does not show the usual background - in fact it has been changed to a kind of texture and your user icons have been changed to circles (a glitch that I found is that they are slightly pixelated, so when upgrading Lion clearly hasn&amp;#39;t bothered to replace those with higher resolution images).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have logged on, you might notice several changes. Firstly, if you used an iPhoto album for your desktop background, it will have reset it to the new Andromeda Galaxy one. (I personally feel that with a little Photoshop work, this amazing photo could become even more spectacular. &lt;a href=&quot;http://darkroom.exofire.net/images/andromeda.jpg&quot;&gt;See my version here&lt;/a&gt;.) This can be fixed by simply going back into your system preferences and changing it back. Other minor changes are the scroll-bar has changed to a simple rectangle with rounded corners and in some cases it has disappeared entirely. This is because, like with the iOS, they only appear when you are actually scrolling. Something else about scrolling that you may have come across is that the scroll direction has been swapped to what, in my opinion, is in fact the more natural way to scroll: when you scroll up, the page moves up, allowing you to see further down the page. If you don&amp;#39;t like this, you can change it by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cultofmac.com/how-to-change-the-scrolling-direction-in-lion-os-x-tips/108120&quot;&gt;going here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are much more profound changes - and because I can&amp;#39;t be bothered to list all of them, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/&quot;&gt;see them here&lt;/a&gt;. The most notable is the full screen for any app, autosave meaning that you never have to bother saving ever again. Probably. But I wouldn&amp;#39;t trust it to be honest. There&amp;#39;s also Launchpad and Mission Control, but neither of these are particularly spectacular in my opinion. If anything, Mission Control is just making OS X more like iOS. But that&amp;#39;s just my opinion. But hey you&amp;#39;re reading this blog, which is all my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I definitely recommend OS X Lion purely for the great value. It also seems to manage the fairly average power of my iMac 21.5&amp;quot; from early 2011 better than Snow Leopard did: everything seems a tiny bit more responsive. This is what Windows should be doing. I&amp;#39;m running Windows 7 on the laptop I&amp;#39;m currently writing this on, and I&amp;#39;ve recently (and accidentally) upgraded to SP 1. There have been literally no noticeable differences, other than my display driver stopped working when it was updated with SP 1, so I just &amp;#39;rolled back the changes&amp;#39; and now it&amp;#39;s fine again. Windows should be making every upgrade as cheap as Mac, and making every upgrade better for the user, not just with tidier coding, which is (as far as I can tell) the only difference in SP 1 (and it fixes an issue with HDMI audio for some users running Professional). Groundbreaking stuff. If only Macs were cheaper, then everyone could enjoy computing as it should be without a hefty price tag. I also hate Office 2010, cos that crashes all the time. So, finally, Windows should be more like Apple, and Apple should be less like Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ps prepare for the rant about Final Cut Pro X)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Is Chromebook a Good Idea?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Google brought out a new operating system, but this time it&amp;#39;s for computers, not phones. The Idea behind the Chromebook is that all your documents, photos, videos, preferences and the like are stored on the web, meaning that the actual Chromebook that you own does not contain any of your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is much like roaming users in your school or office - the actual computers that you log in to boot off the network and all your personal preferences etc... are also stored on the network. One major difference though is that the Chromebook will (as Google say) not have a hard drive. Theoretically this is impossible - when you boot there must be some firmware that displays before you connect to your first WiFi network, and also what happens if while the laptop is on you move away from a WiFi hotspot and there is no 3G connection (some Chromebooks will have in-built 3G)? Will it just crash?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are many more problems with being completely cloud based - what if the Google server is down? What if somehow your internet is cut off? But on a more serious note, how do you know if your data is being sent securely or not? And this kind of machine is much more susceptible to attacks from people on shared (cafe etc) wireless networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_96&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;210&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;The only icon on your non-existent desktop&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http://newfangled.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/google-chrome-flatten-logo1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://newfangled.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/google-chrome-flatten-logo1.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;Google Chrome Icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I move on the idea of Chrome being the only software usable on these machines. OK - Google have come up with Gmail, Docs, Calendar, Translate, etc.. (needed for the main bulk of users) but there are still many things that you can&amp;#39;t do, like making films or making websites (you can&amp;#39;t run a localhost server for example, because 3rd party software is not allowed) ... I wonder why I brought that up...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that the Chromebook is meant to be a cheaper and faster version of the MacBook Air, but it doesn&amp;#39;t have the main thing that the Air has going for it - lightness. Also an advantage of the Air is that it comes with the (in my opinion) best operating system on the planet: without using a great deal of battery life it still looks amazing, feels amazing and anybody can develop software for it. (As well as being able to run Garageband, the essential tool for low-to-no-budget filmmakers, and Final Cut Pro X, more about those two coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people looking for an iPad with a keyboard, go buy an iPad and go buy a wireless keyboard with the cover to hold them both. The iPad has a multitude of apps that have a variety of functions. For those looking for a cheaper MacBook Air, save up a bit more and buy one anyway. However, if all you do is want a portable but big-screened portal to the internet, I recommend it. As much as I love Google and their products, I don&amp;#39;t see the point of this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Links to My Stuff</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello All.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested - here are some links to recent projects. (Most of them are heavily intermingled with Duck House Productions, my small yet awesome production company that was founded before the MPs&amp;#39; expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Welcome</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to this new and amazing blog about - you guessed it - film and stuff. I&amp;#39;ll be keeping you up to date with all things to do with making films, watching films, and other life-ish stuff. Have fun and don&amp;#39;t hold it against me if I rant. I tend to do that when I get overexcited and angry at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes. I forgot to mention who I am - Alex Forey, aged 14 today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already know a lot for a 14 year old (but I&amp;#39;m not gonna be big-headed). For instance, I have already done commercial film work, used some of the most advanced software on the planet and I know how to code in over 8 languages fluently... as you might say. I also watch lots of films and go to lots of theatre. Shortly to follow will be my review of War Horse in the West End. If you don&amp;#39;t know where that is you shouldn&amp;#39;t be here. Or go look it up - I don&amp;#39;t want to lose readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;
